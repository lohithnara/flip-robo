9,5,This is super fast laptop in the budget segment. Good for school and college work. Due to SSD the speed is very fast. Can easily play games. Screen is very good but not great. Handles most of the daily work with pleasurest ease. Not sure if this can be used for video editing...but I hv seen videos which says so!!
10,4,"Laptop is really great. Before buying I was in confusion between Ryzen and Intel. After 7 days of usage, I felt no difference. I continuously use my laptop for office and movies at least 10 hours a day and didn't e even notice any heating problem. If you are looking for a laptop below 45k with good performance, just go for it."

I play PUBG on Smooth Extreme and it's totally smooth.

23,4,"If you are looking for a laptop for graphic intensive tasks like video editing , photoshop , playing heavy games then this is the best you can get under 50k for sure. Because this laptop has 6gb ram for graphics alone!

On the other hand if you want it for regular office work like browsing , streaming content , or making word and ppts then I would recommend you to go with an i3 laptop which will cost around 35k .

25,5,"Looks surprisingly sleek for an entry level gaming laptop so it can be easily carried into professional environment as it doesn't have that flashy gamer body design but packs a punch under the hood. I'm very impressed by what this device is capable of. I've bought this mainly for college work and the GTX 1650 graphics card really enabled this machine to game as well as perform college tasks.

26,4,If you want a lowest budget gaming laptop then i would recommend this one as i got it in 45000 during big billion sale. If you are a gamer & want a lowest budget laptop with high specs then go for it but if your budget is good then you should go for other laptops. The working is perfect but when i purchased this one around a month my laptop adapter gone down & it took a week for a new one.
27,5,"Everything is best.
In this price range it is beast. Boot up speed upto 6 seconds . Display is awesome there is no screen bleeding problem. Resulation is also good. Build quality also good. Sound is enough for a single room not so bad it's good.
Lastly I want to say that if you want to buy a budget gaming laptop then you should go for it.
Wait for more update after using few days ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Played a few games like Valorant and Fortnite along with some heavy games including Witcher 3(got a constant 60 fps in Witcher 3) easily able to get more than 120 fps in Valorant and CSGO.The only problem is the battery life isn't that great.
I suggest you to play games with the charger connected. The screen is average though it is better than the rest. Writing this review after completing solid 6 months. You can buy if you are able to get this for 49-50k..."
29,4,"Very decent configuration on paper. Fairly decent to work with too.
My points of contention -
a. Loaded with tons of 'bloatware' - from HP, Microsoft etc.
b. Flimsy construction - especially the keyboard
c. Flimsier trackpad - absence of the left & right-click buttons, makes the trackpad an all-in-one piece of plastic which rattles on extended use. I'd suggest the use of an external mouse, right from the start

So, for 44K it's a good buy. Especially for WFH challenges and for online classes."
30,5,"Good product. Delivered 2 days in advance of originally committed date. Very good packaging. Appreciate the service. Product is good as specified, light weight, screen is bright and attractive."

32,5,Good product
33,5,"It's a good laptop with no issue as such ! Screen is IPS good viewing angles ! Battery is decent 4-5hr easily!
Build quality is good previously i was using HP 14s i3 11th gen, the quality was poor, though it is a good laptop when it comes to performance.
The only issue is it's VRAM which is 512mb quite low !! You can't play GTA V in even 720p, which is possible in i3 11th gen which can play it in 1080p.
Rest it's a good piece of hardware."
34,4,Looks is fine... Easy to carry! But can't play a normal 4k video from pendrive and there is no antiglare display. So in sunlight or in normal bright light you might face some issues. Otherwise it's a good choice.

The processor, ram and ssd combination is good enough for web development. I didn't face any lag while coding in vs code. Used photoshop and illustrator as well. Display is too good.

So the laptop arrived after 3 days and was inside 3 boxes. Coming to the review:
8GB ram is a bit less, should definitely upgrade to 16GB. However, it has warranty sticker om top of one of the screws, so I don't know if you can upgrade it yourself. Acer service center will charge you 8k for the ram upgrade (P.S. - I personally went there and checked).

66,4,"A budget laptop. 8GB RAM makes it a little bit faster. Decent display, lightweight (easy to carry) and preloaded windows 10 operating system are some of its highlights at its budget price range. It is useful for net surfing, for online classes, watching movies etc. However it is not for gaming as it does not have a graphics card. Sound is not up to the mark. Camera quality is low.

107,5,Excellent.. starting we have to wait 15minutes to start . after start .it will be nice..
108,5,"The product is awesome.
Don't believe in the myth that due to the absence of SSD the system will be very much slower.
Only it takes time in the booting for the first time. Once it's setup then no problem at all.
Don't waste extra 5000K for SSD if you are not a gamer."

113,5,"I have been using it for the past 10 days and it is a superfast machine.

Pros:
Ryzen processor is top class and is super quick.
Build quality is top notch and it is quite stylish and has an elegant look.
Battery backup of this is second to none. U can use it for like 8-10 hours at full computing.
Fingerprint Scanner is quite good and not even once I faced any issue with that.
A lot of talk about display being poor but it is quite good and for normal use, it is quite sufficient and enough.

118,5,"It‚Äôs a great value for money. Good performance, looks and very versatile. Sound is also good."
119,5,"Awesome product. I never thought AMD is this powerful. I can almost perform all of my tasks.
Due to touch screen the display is glossy which creates a mirror like reflection at outdoors, this is the only CON observed so far."
120,3,I think it is very good except two things battery and heating problem
121,5,"It's awesome laptop, AMD ryzen 5 4500 with this price with a touch screen features is amazing deal, go for it without any hesitation, battary back is around 8-9hrs for online classes, display is good, 60k go for it blindly"

127,5,Thanks to the seller for before time delivery. This just value for money. Excellent performance without heat up.
128,5,Very nice build and performance you can see

Everything is excellent in this price range, buil quality is also good, value for money product. If your budget is around 65-70 you must go for this product."

137,4,It's good. If having decent budget go for this.
138,3,"As far as I m concern,the look and design is quite impressive. It is thin and light which really satisfied my desire, but it‚Äôs resolution is not good. After all it is really compact and cozy."
139,4,"The product is meeting expectations , but the display is rather bleak ,second thing is memory ram chipset . It is said the memory ram has frequency 2133 MHz ,but when start installing second memory chip I saw its Kingston 2666 MHz . Which is better then the description"

157,5,To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.üëåüëåüëå

My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3."

1. Heating issues while playing heavy games
2. Front camera not up to the mark
3. Minor fps drops while playing pubg(but acceptable and decent gaming performance)

Pros:
1. Good battery performance
2. Brilliant display
3. Rear camera is really good
4. Best phone speaker in this price range
5. Charging speed is also good

Note:There is one bug in Realme ui 2.0 which came as a trial version in device after one security update. Pictures which taken in Default camera is over sharpened and not looked like naturally I hope They will fill this in next update."

PRONS:-
1. Front selfie camera is best

CONS:-
1. The back camera is not so good. It's just o.k and up to mark.
2. The resolution of phone is not so good.
3. The look is just satisfying l.
4. Gives good experience while playing games but not so great feel for gamers."

394,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.

After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
395,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
396,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
397,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
398,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
399,4,"Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level.
Thank you for such an amazing product."
400,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.

Pros
1. Looks good and stylish
2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app
3. Vibration with notification is very strong

Cons
1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes
2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi
3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
401,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
402,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.

The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play.

552,5,Product is as advertised on site. Received it the very next day after ordering. Very well packaged. Monitor is extremely easy to assemble as we need to attach the base and tighten one screw which is already present in the base itself. I am using VGA for connectivity as I have a slightly older laptop model. Colors are rendered well on full-hd. This is my first experience with a curved monitor -- curve is probably not needed for a 24 inch monitor perhaps for larger ones it makes sense. The curv...
553,5,"best budget gaming monitor FHD+ Display What else can i ask for a 23.6 inch curved monitor which is almost bezel less and having a beautiful stand. Using it for around 3 weeks. There are various pre adjusted colour modes to suit your eyes in any condition. Have all necessary ports in the monitor, i.e. vga port, dvi port, hdmi port, audio port. As it is a 60-75hz monitor, it is not meant for high end real time gaming.

563,5,"It's a very good product has good clarity, adequate refresh rate and is pretty reasonable priced. I want to specifically mention that though this does not have height adjustment,but INCLUDES TILT ADJUSTMENT. Please check for screws in the cavity of the notch in the stand you are attaching to the back of the monitor.,( They are under a black tape sometimes) else everything is worth the money"

it is actually lcd moniter with led backlight, when black. colour comes on screen it looks too darker like almoded display"
573,4,Nice on price worth! but not good for long view / side view I have purchased it for the purpose of a TV in my room. Sound quality is low less bass and volume over all loved it!
574,5,The product was great I am loving it and it's working properly and nice packaging nice monitor
575,4,Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.
576,5,Amazing work good quality display mind-blowing super fast delivery
577,3,"I am little bit angry. This is LCD Monitor not HD + LED described by your heading line.

Lastly I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è ... because LCD 19.5 inch good and fit with the price.
Nice Packaging.

Thank you Flipkart."
578,5,"I am writing this review after making fair and reasonable used the Monitor for 1 month.

The product quantity:
The Acer monitor is a good quality monitor. I am satisfied with the product. It is running fine till date. It is promptly delivered as described in the Flipkart. I say my sincere thanks to Acer Team and Flipkart team."
579,4,"Ok, good product but not same as said. It is a hd display not a hd+ display. They also don't gave me screw to mount it to wall.But the best thing is the hdmi port. I personally love it. 1 year onsite warranty and 2 year maintainance warranty."
580,4,I am not satisfied with built in speaker and display type is LCD not led but though it's good product in this price segment .
581,5,"Although the monitor is great, and very vibrant, I would like to suggest the seller to change the product detail as this monitor only support vga and hdmi input and not dvi as shown in pictures, and another thing, the mac resolution is 1344 x 728 and not 1600 x 900 as mentioned on the details page. Other than that, it's a very good monitor with a little wider fov."

583,2,"I ordered the monitor just for it's 1ms response time and the VA Panel. Sadly it didn't turned well. I have been using IPS displays for all my life and switching to VA was a very bad decision.

Pros
Light
Good design and the stand looks way better than any of the monitors out there.
Lots of additional features and you get to configure it according to you. Has multiple modes.(Sports, Movies, and many more)

Cons
The VA Panel is not for you if you have been using IPS Displays. Please buy an I..."
584,4,"Good product , Good Delivery , Delivery boy is Friendly handled. Thanks for support"
585,4,"After using it for a year, i feel the Monitor is good for its price. I have faced no issues with the monitor yet.

The colours are good, the Black Levels are adequate and u can adjust it too.
It says 1ms response time but by default it is 4ms. You can turn on the VRB mode to get 1ms but it may strain your eyes.

I would say there is no such noticeable difference in 60hz or 75hz.

For Gaming, You would love playing Story Mode games in this Monitor as the colour output is good. But for Compet..."

592,5,The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works. It has speakers but they are very tiny and not useful but it has audio output for attaching external speakers.
593,4,"BenQ 22inch panel monitor looks and work great, easy to assemble. Packaged in very protective manner, deliver was good. Much satisfied with this purchase.
Down side: Volume is considerable low. Power input cord is large 3 pin which generally seen with A/C, refrigerators and washing machines. Its uncommon in household we have many of such sockets at right spot."
594,5,"It's been a month, i m using the monitor, its working very well, the IPS panel is really nice, viewing angles, colour, sharpness everything is good. Reading, browsing, watching YouTube videos can be done smoothly. Speaker volume is too low but i don't really need them.
What i didn't like about the monitor is that it takes almost 5 seconds to turn on.
Other than that its amazing so i'm rating 5 starts wanted to rate 4.75 but there's no option, so 5 it is."
595,5,Good Colors. Value For Money Product.
596,5,fabulous product
597,4,Good
598,4,"After using for one day, I can say this monitor is fine but you have purchase a 6 Amp power cable seperately around Rs120, because the power pable provided with the is of 16Amp which does not fit the switch board."
599,1,Nowhere in the description or on the box it mentions that 16A sized 3pin cable is included with monitor. That size is used for Fridge/Microwave etc and doesn't fit in a regular 3 pin socket. Can not use this monitor without buying a convertor now. Highly disappointing that this is not mentioned in any of the product details.
600,5,"Good monitor for daily browsing. Auto eye care technology with 2 hdmi Port. No hdmi cable including but a dvi cable in this package . Sound is very weak. But u have audio output near hdmi Port
I got it 7.2 k in festival day s . screen is good.also have auto detect input."

602,4,"I appreciate the fast delivery in this situation but i don't appreciate how it arrived. The product came in a bit wet from the rain, the delivery guy could have taken it bit more carefully since its an electronic item. I hope the water didn't get inside the box."
603,5,"Good, fast delivery.

Good monitor for office work and 1080p gaming. Amd free sync ability helps go 75Hz without vsync. Colors could be better, though. And the dynamic contrast ratio is more pain than pleasure.

Bezels are not as narrow as it seems. The rim is definitely narrow and the glass big, but when on you will notice gaps around the screen on the edges, under glass.

No bundled driver. Default drivers work fine but if you want a bit more functionality use the online driver/controller ..."

612,1,"I just bought it today and I am using it with my macbook air 2017. Color of this display turns pink while using and completely ruins the experience. And, there are two more issues: power button is very funny like a toy.. and display automatically disconnects while using!!"

623,5,I purchased this for working from home. This is very light and thin. Supports HDMI and VGA. It has very thin bezels. Overall I am satisfied with the 1080p display that has very good viewing angles.
624,3,"Monitor is good but the adjustable stand is not at all suitable, you can't adjust it top and bottom like we do in dell monitors."

642,5,"Quality is good viewing angles are also good IPS panel display but the sound output is very less, lesser than the mobile phone, inbuilt speakers are useless,One VGA input and one HDMI , also the auto matic brighness feature also working well comparing the price with other available in the market the product is very good."
643,4,"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!"
644,5,"A perfect monitor for content creators and students and IT employees. It's been 3 months now working great for me, and you can customize the view angle and adjust for eye vision. Thanks flipkart and local delivery person Mr.Meganathan for the speedy and secure delivery!!!"
645,5,"I had LG 24 also, I had bought that at much higher price. But this Benq 24 is simply amazing comparing LG or Dell at this price point.

I liked it. Great viewing angles with no white colour bleeding."
646,3,"It's an ok item, not best in class. Speaker is useless you can not listen music even if you are alone in your house, picture quality is not up to the mark. If you want to watch some content on your monitor so it is not for you.it is good for office work only. Aap it is an OK item but it is Good by price point. Make sure Don't Go by seeing Eye Care option it's also useless. Picture quality is really near to bad. But not bad at all."
647,5,"Monitor is well built and IPS panel is good enough for multimedia consumption and development purposes.

Pros:
1. BI sensor works really great. It adjusts the colour temperatures automatically based on room brightness.
2. Auto turn off feature works just as advertised. It Saves power consumption when it is sitting idle.
3. Quality HDMI cable is given in the box.
4. Out of the box settings are sufficient enough to use it without any extra efforts.

650,5,Was looking for options in more popular brands and a local retailer suggested that BenQ is worthy one. Multiple input/output options makes it very convenient. Upto the expectation. Eye care technology is of great value.

Package contains - HDMI wire, Power Cord, Stand Base, Stand Top, Led Monitor.

I setup-ed this product in just 5-10 min. without using any screwdriver.

In-built speaker is good but not for movie or other stuff. if you work on system and wanna listen some music you can do ..."
652,4,"A must have for people who work on coding or your office work. You can have the screen tilted in any direction you like. You can get other monitors for cheaper price but make sure you get a stand like this.

The downside the cables which comes along with it are of no use. You won't be able to make it work with you laptop. I have a z book which has almost all the connectors available but the cables which comes along with this monitor doesn't work at all."
653,5,"Brought for 9899 Big Savings Day May 2021

Pros
Highly adjustable stand.
Bezel less 24"" good quality display
Usb hub with 2 3.0 on side (use it for pendrive and all) and 2 2.0s on back side (connected ny keyboard and mouse to it)
Cons (nitpicking ofcourse)
No audio out
No HDMI cable included
No included speakers"
654,5,"Really good quality product. But remember, you have to Calibrate it at the beginning, which is pretty easy too! Awesome build quality. Colour, Saturation & Sharpness is just the perfect!

Important Note: If connected over HDMI, change the default 'RGB' mode to 'YCbCr' to achieve an accurate blackness of the screen, resulting in to perfect Saturation."
655,4,Nice Product. Suitable for work from home. It does not have HDMI Cable in the package. We need to buy it as a separate one. But overall nice monitor for Work From Home with good budget

661,1,"Guys please don't buy from ZRPL. They are the worst seller's. Please avoid purchasing from this seller.
They provided very big 3pin connector which is generally used for heater and heavy duty works. I have seen other dell monitors but they dont have this much big 3pin connector.
Sometimes buttons are not working. Pixel color correction are not proper."

Look and feel of monitor is Good and as expected

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AUSTRALIAN IMPORT SO NO INDIAN POWER CABLE.........................."
681,4,"The monitor was worth an investment. The display is nice and the screen area cover is good too. I am yet to discover all the display features but the options of brightness to be set for reading, net surfing, etc is a good one.

The base of the stand delivered to me looks to have a very minor scratch like it was already used. And a screw on the back side of the monitor looked loosened and worn out.
