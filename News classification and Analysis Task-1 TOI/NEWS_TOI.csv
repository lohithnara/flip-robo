Bickram told us, “It’s always lovely to be present at the club’s New Year’s Eve bash. Jaya, our elder son, Adit, and I are having a super time. The music is great.

"Sunayana Suresh | TNN | Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,City,Veda Krishnamurthy: 2020 is exciting for women's cricket,"She’s an intrinsic part of the batting line-up for the Indian women’s cricket team. Bengaluru-based Veda Krishnamurthy has become the pin-up girl for many aspirants in Karnataka and India. She is excited about the upcoming 2020 T20 World Cup in Australia, where she says, “We have a lot to live up to, as the Indian women’s cricket team has announced that we are in it for the big haul.” Excerpts…
How does 2020 look for women’s cricket in general and you in particular?
2020 looks very exciting for women’s cricket. We have the Women’s T20 World Cup coming up this year, followed by the 50-over World Cup that will be held early next year. It is going to be a very busy and exciting year for us. There is a lot at stake, not just for those playing cricket and in the team, but for those who are vying for a spot to play for the nation.
As for me, I have ended the last year well, so I hope I carry forward the same form. Since the World Cup is very close, I hope to continue all that I’ve been doing for the past three-four months. We’ve got a core group with members who have been playing together for a while. I am hoping that everything works for us.
What is going to be India’s biggest strength at the 2020 World Cup?
That’s a tough question. I think our biggest strength are our spinners, they are superior compared to the teams across the world. Our spinners bowl most of the 20 overs, so if our spinners get it right, it will work the most in our favour. Given the fire power that we have in our batting, a good show by the spinners can help boost and complement that.
The camaraderie within the team is very important to keep the rhythm and chemistry of a batting line-up going. How do you girls bond when not playing?
If you see our social media accounts, especially Instagram, there is a lot of banter that goes on between us. We are always active, we all tend to comment when someone posts something new, which actually shows the bond we share. We are basically a bunch of youngsters, so there is so much energy off the field as well. For instance, if one starts to dance, the other 14 join in. If one sings, the other 14 do so too. We do almost everything together, it is natural and organic. In fact, I feel our bond off the field reflects on the field too. This is important for those who are part of a team, and this team shares that kind of bond.
Which is the team that our team is watching out for?
Any day, it is Australia hands down. They have been so dominating in the past few years and they are the defending champions playing in their home conditions. They are going to be our biggest competition. But, since it is T20, it is also about who clicks on that day. It depends on the performance on that particular day.
Is there anything you feel is required or not in place yet to give women’s cricket that extra push?
The ICC has done a good job of spacing out various events. We saw that with the 2017 World Cup as well. There was a lot of publicity. There were many hoardings and ads during the men’s Champions Trophy, which brought in awareness about the event. There was a lot of talk about women’s cricket too, there was a lot of crowd and a lot of people watched it even back home in India.
Now, since the next World Cup is happening in Australia, which is also a country where people love their sport, there is a lot of thought that is going into the planning of these events. Incidentally, our final match coincides with International Women’s Day. The BCCI is making sure all our games are televised, including those played at the domestic levels. They are putting a lot of effort to get the domestic scene right. Now, people are aware of the women’s cricket team and the fixtures. If one compares the 2017 World Cup to the upcoming T20 World Cup, people are aware that the match is happening in Australia. Awareness is half the battle won.
You have met upcoming players who are part of Karnataka’s women’s cricket team. What is the potential you see there?
We’ve got a very good bunch of youngsters. Karnataka has one of the few associations that train children right from the time they are about 10-11 years of age. They are trained to be a part of the under-16 games. There are a lot of youngsters to watch out for. At the same time, it is about them doing well in their age group, and continuing to perform well at the next level. That is the kind of potential selectors look for — they see who has the potential to perform well in the next level.
Off field appearances have been taking up a lot of your free time. Do you find it challenging to put in an effort towards styling yourself?
I’m getting better at that. Though, even today, if I am hanging out with my friends, you will find me in my joggers, t-shirt and chappals. But over time, I am also becoming more aware of what suits me in terms of outfits, hair and makeup. I am learning."

"Sruthi Raman | TNN | Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,City,Gully is everything: Divine,"Dressed in his characteristic black leather jacket and a cap, Vivian Fernandes is a man of few words. But say the word gully, and the idolised rapper’s eyes light up. “Gully is everything. That is where my journey began and it is something that I keep going back to,” the rapper says, flashing a smile, as we pulled him aside for a quick chat at his recent Gully Gang concert in Chennai.
Known better by his stage name, Divine, the underground rapping sensation is one of the main forces behind catapulting regional hip hop to Indian audiences. His inspiring journey from the streets of Mumbai found a prominent appearance in Zoya Akhtar’s breakout rap drama Gully Boy, which was inspired by Mumbai rappers Naezy and himself. The Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt-starrer traces the journey of a rapper from working-class Mumbai. Rapping, to Divine, is all about expressing stories from his community. His work often reflects his own personal experiences, which help him strike a connection with listeners, he says.
Representing Bombay and its stories was one of the reasons why Vivian wanted to become a musician. “One of the reasons I became a musician is to tell stories about my gully to people. I had so many stories I had to tell about Bombay and that is how my journey with hip hop began,” he says. His introduction to hip hop, too, has an interesting backstory. He once spotted his friend from school wearing a t-shirt of American rapper 50 Cent. “That was my first taste of hip hop. I wanted to know more about hip hop and from there I never stopped,” he adds. While he first equated hip hop to English music, he eventually realised that hip hop was whatever anyone wanted it to be. “I always thought hip hop was supposed to be in English. But I later realised that it is more than that. Someone had to tell stories of communities from every nook and corner,” Vivian says, adding that hip hop has grown leaps and bounds since he started out.
Did Gully Boy propel more people to embrace the genre? “I think the Bombay hip hop scene was already thriving even before the film released. But the big screen experience in India is truly something else. The film definitely helped catapult the emerging hip movement across the country in different regions. It also gave people a peek into the lives of musicians like us and perhaps even made them want to find out more about hip hop artistes in their own community or locality,” says the musician.
Like it is with many other cities, Chennai, too, has an emerging hip hop scene, he observed. “Chennai’s hip-hop scene is exciting, like it is in many parts of the country. I have come to perform in Chennai before in a college, but this is my first ever big concert here,” he says, further fondly recalling his collaborations with Madurai rap ensemble Madurai Souljour and Sid Sriram. “I recently collaborated with Sid Sriram for this song Too Hype from my album Kohinoor. We had such a fun time. Madurai Souljour and I, too, teamed up for a video song. The south hip-hop scene is definitely something to look forward to,” he adds with a grin, before going on to serenade his fans waiting a few metres away."

"Marcus Mergulhao | Jan 4, 2020, 00:12 IST",Marcus Mergulhao,City,Hurt Churchill Brothers eager to bounce back,"Panaji: Bernardo Tavares was really angry, and so were the rest of the players. The loss against Indian Arrows was unexpected and nobody could look at the Churchill Brothers FC coach in the eye.
In the dressing room, there was funeral silence. At the training ground the next day, the mood was no different, before the Portuguese coach reminded everyone that there is a tomorrow.
That tomorrow has come. But the challenge would be even stiffer as Churchill cross swords with East Bengal in an I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.
Until that loss against AIFF’s developmental side – after taking the lead – Churchill had won two games in a row, including a convincing one against Mohun Bagan, away. The loss at home took away the momentum, and three crucial points, which might prove to be the difference in the end.
“It was disappointing, to be honest. We had 19 shots on goal, while they had just four and Arrows scored from two big mistakes of ours. We must look at that game like an accident. I know that the performance, particularly with shooting, won’t happen again,” Tavares told TOI on Friday.
For the last one week, Tavares has seen a noticeable difference within the team. “They are more focused and want to paint a different image of the team,” said the Portuguese coach, who believes that the character of the team is best reflected during times of crisis like this defeat brought.
“It won’t be any easy for us against East Bengal. In my mind, they are the best team, alongside maybe Mohun Bagan. They are first in the table, haven’t lost as yet and they have two players for every position. They are not just strong with their eleven (players), they have equally competent players on the bench,” said Tavares.
East Bengal coach Alejandro Menendez will be pleased with such glowing praise. They are the only undefeated team in the league, pulling themselves clear with two consecutive victories after the initial draws against Real Kashmir FC and Punjab FC.
“We come here with a lot of confidence. We come after winning games. We know that it’s a big game in this league and our idea is to win. I expect the team to show the same level like the previous games,” the East Bengal coach told reporters.
The visitors will be without defender Mehtab Singh and winger Pintu Mahanta, both of whom are suffering from chickenpox, but like Tavares pointed out, they should still have enough in reserves.
“I am sure that Churchill Brothers will come back even stronger (after the loss). They will put in more effort, physically and mentally. But I know we will compete. We need to negotiate tough games. We don’t expect any easy outings,” said Menendez."
"Paresh Mokani | Jan 4, 2020, 00:14 IST",Paresh Mokani,City,"Ranji Trophy: Vijesh, Sumiran put Goa on top","Panaji: Goa took a lead of 119 runs against Manipur on the first day of the Plate Division Ranji Trophy at the Academy ground, Porvorim, on Friday. Right-arm medium pacer Vijesh Prabhudessai stole the limelight with an excellent spell where he took six wickets for 14 runs in 10 overs as the hosts bowled out Manipur for 106 in 32.1 overs.
Goa were 225-2 as opener Sumiran Amonkar (115) hit the fourth ton of his career. Vaibhav Govekar (64*) and night watchman Amulya Pandrekar (4*) were at the crease at the end of the day's play.
Goa captain Amit Verma won the toss and had no hesitation in asking the visitors to bat first. The 22-year-old Vijesh found early rhythm as he got rid of opener Bonny Chingangbam when he edged a ball to keeper Smit Patel on the third ball of his first over. Sultan Karim (2) was his next victim as Vijesh shattered his wicket. On the first delivery of his third over, he trapped Akshaykumar Singh in front of the wicket for nought, leaving Manipur reeling at 3-5 in the fifth over.
Four balls later, Jayanta Sagatpam failed to break his duck when he gave an easy catch to Suyash Prabhudessai in the gully. The visitors were soon in deep trouble when they lost five wickets for five runs. Captain Kangabam Singh was caught behind by the keeper off Vijesh.
Vijesh was on a roll as he took all six wickets. He trapped Karam Dharmendra leg before wicket in the 10th over, the fourth batsman getting out on zero.
Allrounder Rex Rajkumar adopted an aggressive approach as he realised it would be futile to carry on as he hammered three fours in his 36-ball 21 before he nicked one to Smit off Lakshay Garg. Smit had a field day as he also caught Thomas Moirangthem (9) off Felix Alemao.
Opener Al Bashid Muhammed, who was holding one end while others fell cheaply, threw caution to the wind by hitting a six and five fours. In an attempt to score quickly, he tried to hit out captain Verma, only to find Lakshay at long on. He was the top scorer with 43 off 88 balls.
Last man Bishworjit Singh tried to do the same by smashing a four and a six before left-arm orthodox spinner Amulya cleaned him up.
With 57 overs to bat, Goa didn't take any chances and batted sensibly. Sumiran and Aditya Kaushik (34) brought up 68 off 17.2 overs before Aditya was caught by Sultan off left-arm orthodox spinner Ajay Lamabam.
Brie scores: Manipur 106 in 32.1 overs (Al Bashid Muhammed 43; Vijesh Prabhudessai 6-14, Amit Verma 1-15) vs Goa 225-2 in 57 overs (Sumiran Amonkar 155, Vaibhav Govekar 64*)"

"Sachin Parashar | TNN | Updated: Jan 5, 2020, 10:26 IST",Sachin Parashar,India,Pompeo discusses Iran situation with Indian envoy,"NEW DELHI: The US has kept India in the loop about developments related to Iran following the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. It is understood that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the situation with outgoing Indian ambassador and foreign secretary-designate Harsh Vardhan Shringla in a meeting after the US airstrike which left Soleimani dead.
Pompeo Friday had a round of telephonic conversations with leaders across the globe as the US sought to explain its strike on Soleimani away as defensive action in response to ""imminent threats"" to American lives. He also spoke to Pakistan army chief Qamar Bajwa, bypassing PM Imran Khan, about the US decision to eliminate Soleimani.
Pompeo is learnt to have emphasised that the US remained committed to de-escalation in the region. With Iran vowing revenge though, US is deploying thousands of troops to the region.
India has been particularly concerned about the latest escalation in US-Iran tensions not just because of its ties with Iran but also the presence of 8 million Indian nationals in the region, who account for more than 50 per cent of around $ 70 billion remittances earned by India every year.
Many in India believe that the US unilateralism in taking out a senior Iranian leader has put India in a bind. It was evident from India's official reaction to Soleimani's killing in which the government sought to play safe as it called for restraint and mentioned how the world had been alarmed.
India is also worried about the fate of its Chabahar port project in Iran which allows it to bypass Pakistan in accessing central Asia and Afghanistan. Even as it forced India to cut crude imports from Iran, the US allowed special exception for Chabahar development in the name of reconstruction assistance and economic development for Afghanistan. If a war indeed is thrust upon the region, it's perhaps safe to say that work on the project will not remain unaffected."
"Paresh Mokani | Jan 5, 2020, 00:23 IST",Paresh Mokani,City,Ranji Trophy: Allround success for Goa at home,"Panaji: Goa did everything right against Manipur on the second day of the Plate Division Ranji Trophy at the Academy ground, Porvorim, on Saturday.
After taking a huge lead of 447 runs, the hosts reduced the visitors to 21-4 in the second innings when stumps were drawn.
Captain Amit Verma had a good day as he took three wickets in the last session to leave the visitors with an inning and 426-run deficit. Earlier, he scored a fluent 89 off 118 balls as Goa declared their first innings at 553-5.
Verma bowled with a plan and set fielding perfectly. He got his first scalp when Sultan Karim failed to judge a length delivery. Trying to cut, he missed the ball and got bowled. Left-arm orthodox Darshan Misal chipped in when he caught Bonny Chingangbam plumb in front for 2. Al Bashid Muhammed, Manipur's top scorer in the first innings, struck two fours and was getting set. However, his stay at the crease was cut short by Verma who foxed him with a straight one. The ball hit the pad and the umpire had no hesitation in raising his finger.
Akshaykumar Singh (0) followed suit as he played a wrong line to get out LBW off Verma.
Earlier, resuming on 225-2, Vaibhav Govekar (88) and night watchman Amulya Pandrekar got off to a great start. Vaibhav could have scored a century on debut. However, allrounder Rex Rajkumar broke through his defence to shatter the left-hander's dream.
Surprise package Amulya, who has been consistent with the bat, was unlucky to miss his half-century, but he did what was expected of him — survive the morning session. Though Rex bowled him for 47, Goa were nicely set at 364-4. Verma batted fluently as he smashed a six and ten fours. His dismissal brought Suyash Prabhudessai, who has been in an excellent form.
What followed was a leather hunt for Manipur. Smit Patel, who usually batted one down, flourished in the middle order. He brought up his ninth century off 117 balls, while Suyash hit a quickfire 61 off 82 balls as the pair recorded an unbeaten 154 run partnership for the sixth wicket. Manipur bowlers toiled for 130 overs. Rex was the only bowler who took two wickets.
Brief scores: Manipur 106 & 21-4 (Amit Verma 3-10) vs Goa 553-5 decl in 130.3 overs (Sumiran Amonkar 115, Smit Patel 100*, Amit 89, Vaibhav Govekar 88; Rex Rajkumar 2-78)."
"Marcus Mergulhao | Jan 5, 2020, 00:25 IST",Marcus Mergulhao,City,I-League: Plaza strikes at death as Churchill Bros end East Bengal’s unbeaten run,"Margao: Alejandro Menendez picked up the first ever I-League coach of the month award for steering an unbeaten East Bengal to the top of the table, but 90 minutes later, he was left with nothing to smile at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.
For most part it looked like East Bengal would return to Kolkata with their unbeaten record intact. But Churchill Brothers FC had other ideas. Smarting from their unexpected loss against Indian Arrows in the previous game, Churchill rose to the occasion with captain Willis Plaza heading home the only goal of the match in the final minute of regulation time.
The 1-0 victory was Churchill’s third in four games and takes them to the top of the table with nine points. The man who plotted all this – Plaza --- remains a familiar name at both ends. For Churchill fans, he is the same player who frustrates and entertains in equal measure, while every time he scores, East Bengal wonder if it’s the same player who they chased away not too long ago.
Even before he made the difference, Plaza was at the centre of everyone’s attention. He had one of his headers kiss the upright, and not surprisingly for someone who doesn’t have an impressive first touch, shot wide from encouraging positions. In the end, though, all was forgotten as he scored the goal that separated the two sides.
East Bengal will be disappointed. They had a majority of the ball in the first session and seemed in control of the proceedings. Jaime Colado came up with some delightful balls and Juan Mera was a constant threat in the rival danger zone, yet the end product was lacking. The visitors could argue that they had found the back of the net when Colado’s corner kick sailed straight into the goal. They celebrated too, only to discover that Mehtab Singh has been adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Jafar Mondal on the goalline.
There were other chances, largely those that fell at the feet of Juan Mera and Lalrindika Ralte inside the box. The Spanish forward first saw him being disposed just in the nick of time by Richard Costa, and a blazing left-footer brushed the upright before sailing out. Dika couldn’t keep his attempt on target from handshaking distance.
Without the injured Ceesay Dawda, Churchill lacked creativity in midfield. The likes of Costa, Glan Martins and even Kalif AlHasan were all enterprising, without really doing much of a damage to the rival citadel.
The major threat, of course, came from Plaza. The Trinidad and Tobago striker bulldozed his way through the East Bengal defence and, from dead-ball situations, had the tall Radanfah Abu Bakr proving an able ally in aerial battles.
The only goal came with a smart header from Plaza who beat his marker, and sandwiched between two defenders, did well to nod substitute Israil Gurung’s inch-perfect cross into the net."
"TNN | Jan 5, 2020, 00:26 IST",null,City,"After Churchill scalp, young Arrows high on confidence","Panaji: If a goal can work wonders for a striker’s confidence, imagine what victory, their first, would do to a young side, playing against giants in the I-League.
Indian Arrows find themselves with a spring in their step ever since they accounted for Churchill Brothers FC 2-1 in the previous game. They were a goal down but turned the tables on the heavyweights to not just register their first win in four matches but also hand Churchill their first defeat, that too at home.
Coach Shanmugham Venkatesh, formerly assistant with the Indian team, understands the importance of the victory and has challenged his boys to make winning a habit. That should start with NEROCA at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Sunday.
“The (Churchill) result will motivate the players. The game (against NEROCA) has three points for us. This team has been together now for four matches and they got the confidence by playing together. We should go for victory,” said Venkatesh.
The young developmental side of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) gave a wonderful account of themselves. They lost the first three games quite narrowly, before opening their account against Churchill.
“We have to now move forward. Three points are at stake,” said Aman Chetri, who provided the assist for Givson Singh’s equaliser.
NEROCA have four points from their first four matches. That’s not an impressive show, even on debut, but a well-fought draw at the home of the defending champions Chennai City in their last outing would have set them up nicely for Sunday’s battle.
“We have to take Indian Arrows seriously. In the last game, they fought well for victory against Churchill. We respect Indian Arrows. They are young lads and great hope for the future. We will need to work hard,” said coach Gift Raikhan
The NEROCA coach said the team needs reinforcements to challenge the best in business and is expecting the arrival of some players who can provide help.
“NEROCA started late and now the transfer window is open for us. We may change three or four players. Unfortunately, we are not doing well at the moment, but a good result can get us back on track,” said the coach."

"Tanvi PS | TNN | Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,City,Writer-director Manju Maandavya begins innings as a hero,"The launch of the trailer and music of Manju Maandavya-Chikkanna-starrer Sri Bharatha Baahubali was held in the city recently. Talking about the movie, which marks his debut as a hero, Manju says, “While I have acted in character roles before, this is my first outing as the leading man. It will see me and Chikkanna back together on screen, again. I play Bharatha and he essays the character of Baahubali.”
The cast and crew share that when Manju approached them and said that he would be playing the lead, they were all quite quizzical about the decision. Music director Manikanth Kadri says, “I knew that Manju is multi-talented. I am aware of his prowess as a writer, director and lyricist — he has also sung a song in the film. He is such a cool person to work with. But, when he told me that he was playing the lead, I was initially wondering how he would pull off the role.” Chikkanna chips in, “When Manju narrated the script to me, I too asked him if he was sure about taking on the lead role. However, after working with him in this movie and having seen the final output, I now know that he fits the part really well. He has also worked really hard to shed oodles of weight and become fitter for this role.” The event saw Sarah Harish, Shreya Shetty, Srinivas Murthy, Prakhyath Paramesh and Kari Subbu, among others in attendance."
"Sunayana Suresh | TNN | Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,City,"I talk to myself constantly, to reinforce that I am capable and can achieve, yet again: Pankaj Advani","Bengaluru-based cueist Pankaj Advani, the 23-time World Champion, is charged up for yet another year filled with tournaments at which he hopes to do what he does each year — win. The only record he beats each year is his own. This year, however, is also about imparting knowledge as Pankaj has initiated a connect with schools in Bengaluru where students can learn the nuances of the sport with him. While they say it gets lonely at the top, there have been rumours of cupid having struck here, which the sportsman insists on guarding. “Will let you know, in good time,” is all he says. Over to Pankaj…
What about 2020 is most exciting for you right now?

It is the beginning of the new year and there are a lot of tournaments lined up as usual, which begins with the National Championships in April. The mid-year will see the Asian Championships, which will be followed by the World Championships. Besides this, I have two things in mind for billiards and snooker.
One is for the sport to be televised, which our federation ought to look in to. A professional league, that is televised, will not only attract viewers, but will also provide more visibility to aspiring cueists. The other, is what I can do in my own capacity through my initiative, Cue Schools by Pankaj Advani. Through this, we hope to be able to take the game to schools. I want to give aspiring cueists a platform to pursue their talent in this sport.
How feasible is it to have a televised professional league?

As a player, I can talk about what I expect for the sport. It is the federation, the administrators, and the people who are in-charge of popularising the sport who should answer this question. All I can say that there was such a league in place back in 2017, and it was televised. I am not sure what happened to it. But it has not been so for the past two years
You have been inclined towards working with new talent, children mostly. What is the plan behind that?

It is very heartening to see the passion with which kids have picked up cue sport. Some of them have immense talent. Few of them also participated in the state ranking events. The whole idea behind my initiative to reach out to school children is to provide a platform for young, aspiring players to hone their skills and to create future champions by developing the grass root level.
On the international front, you have been beating your own records each year. Do you have any quirks or mantras that you follow to motivate yourself before participating in every championship?

The hunger to achieve is very important, as is the belief in yourself. You have to constantly remind yourself, that you are the player who won the last time around, and that you need to be better than that. One only sees the achievements and the titles at the end of the day, but the process to get there takes a lot out of you — both emotionally and physically. A sportsperson’s career goes through loads of ups and downs, it is never smooth. In that sense, I feel I am a constant work in progress. One cannot always be at one’s peak, because there are always other factors in life that change and, therefore, affect the way one performs at a match. It is not easy to maintain the same levels of energy and intensity. I talk to myself constantly, sometimes in front of the mirror and sometimes when I am alone. I remind myself that I have done it in the past, and reinforce the belief that I am still capable of doing it — yet again, any day and anytime. Before playing a major tournament, I tend to get into a shell, I don’t talk much to people. It is even more so when I am travelling. I limit myself to reading on my own during these competitions. My family and closest friends understand my need to be by myself before a tournament and let me be too.
As someone who has excelled in individual sports like billiards and snooker, how do you feel you may have fared in team sport?

The dynamics of team sport is very different when compared to that of individual sport. In an individual sport, you’re completely in charge of your performance. If you win, you take all the credit. If you lose, you take all the blame for the loss. It is good in a way, because you do not have any external factor to blame or comment on. It is just you and your performance in the arena. In team sports, it is not just your performance, but also the relationship with your teammates, among other things, that tend to matter. There are times when players within the team end up trying to compete against each other. That, thankfully, is not something I need to deal with.
Team members are also subjected to the ‘selection’ process, in which one is at the mercy of the selectors. In individual sport, all you need to do is play well, and you are soon in the top line-up of the country’s players and you are representing India. As long as you are playing well, nobody is going to stop you. This is what I’ve been used to and cannot think of anything else.
Do you dabble in any other sport?

Well, I’m only good at one and I’d rather let it be that way (laughs). Though, I love watching tennis and I am eagerly waiting for the Australian Open to see if the big three (Djokovic, Nadal and Federer) can still reign supreme or will the gen next take over."

"TNN | Updated: Jan 6, 2020, 12:35 IST",null,null,GST wing seeks strict vigil on exporters,"NEW DELHI: The revenue department has asked the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to go for a more robust check of ""star exporters"" after an investigation found that nine top category trading houses were ""not traceable"" at addresses mentioned by them.
Also, 40 out of 241 entities that were scanned declared turnover from of zero to less than Rs 1 crore during 2017-18 and 2018-19, although they were expected to have annual exports of at least $3 million (over Rs 20 crore) to be eligible for the status.
""Star"" status entitles exporters to several facilities, including reduced customs inspections. Given the massive amount of frauds detected by GST authorities, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has now written to DGFT to continuously seek a compliance and verification reports from other regulators or mandate exporters to produce statutory records of compliance, including certifications from the banks that they have not been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) for loan default.

The investigation was undertaken after GST authorities initiated a drive to crack down on fraudulent claims of Integrated GST. Exporters have been one of the most vocal critics of the new indirect tax regime with lobby groups, including the Federation of Indian Export Organisations as well as export promotion councils, repeatedly flagging this as a major concern, arguing that a holdup of refunds had increased their operating costs.
The issues are expected to be discussed by revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, when he meets officers from state and central GST as well as representatives from the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Financial Intelligence Unit, later this week to look at new steps to check frauds. On January 2, TOI had reported that the government is looking at new ways to clamp down on GST frauds, including access to bank account details.
Tax authorities said widespread irregularities have been noticed during the probe initiated by them. Of the nine ""star"" exporters that were ""not traceable"" at the addresses on record, in two cases the premises were also found sealed and seized by the banks as the exporters had been classified as NPAs.
In another case, a garment exporter with over Rs 50 crore turnover took refund of Rs 3.9 crore when the total tax payment in cash was Rs 1,650. Similarly, tax payments in cash were to the tune of Rs 51,201, while the exporter obtained refunds of Rs 9.6 crore. While a part of the tax payment can be made in cash, tax paid on inputs, which are to be set off or refunded, can be used to meet the other tax obligations.
Investigators, however, accuse these exporters of using fake invoices and fraudulent tax credits, which have been encashed through the facility of IGST refunds."

"Rupali Mukherjee | TNN | Updated: Jan 6, 2020, 12:39 IST",Rupali Mukherjee,null,Patent office rejects Tatas' plea for Swach water purifier,"MUMBAI: Patent wars have intensified in the water purifier market, with biggies Tata Chemicals and Hindustan Unilever (HUL) slugging it out in courts.
The Delhi patent office has rejected an application by Tata Chemicals for its water purifier Swach on grounds of it being ""obvious"" and ""lacking in inventive step"". The plea was rejected on January 2, on a pre-grant opposition filed a decade ago by HUL, which owns the Pureit brand.
Over the years, the market has witnessed several such court battles between major players - HUL, Eureka Forbes and Tata Chemicals. In 2012, HUL lost its patent on Pureit, when the Intellectual Property Appellate Board ruled the technology used by it was not new, and was obvious.
Simply put, inventive step means a feature of the invention that involves technical advance over what is known, and not something obvious to a person skilled in that art (field), according to the Patent Act. Legal sources told TOI the Patent Office relied on a previous case where Tata Chemicals had succeeded in getting HUL's patent concerning Pureit, revoked in 2012.
Tata Chemicals and Tata Consultancy had filed the patent application in July 2008 through Obhan & Associates, while the HUL side was represented by Subhatosh Majumdar of S Majumdar & Co. According to the Tata group, ""The design of the claimed device is such that filtration medium doesn't get impacted because in villages it may be used in a different way, and uneven force and pressure may be applied to the filter so it is designed in such a manner that it is able to sustain for a long time.""
A Tata Chemicals spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the order. Decision to appeal will be taken post review."""

IDBI has invoked and transferred pledged shares at regular intervals from July last year. Yes Bank has also invoked shares. The shares were invoked from the accounts of promoter V G Siddhartha, and the promoter group, including Siddhartha's wife Malavika Hegde, Coffee Day Consolidations, Devadarshini Info, Gonibenu Coffee Estates and Sivan Securities.
The filing with the BSE showed that an additional 12.6% of the shares are encumbered with lenders, leaving the promoter group with only 5.1% of shareholding that’s unencumbered.
Coffee Day Enterprises' share price has plummeted since Siddhartha's suicide in July. The price was around Rs 200 then. On Friday, it closed at Rs 39.4 on the BSE.
The company’s net debt as on March 31, 2019, stood at Rs 4,796 crore.
CDEL chairman Ranganath, at the recent AGM, said the company was making steady progress in reducing debt by monetising non-core assets and exploring the sale of some group companies.
The board and management also placed before the shareholders major plans to improve the financial fortunes of the company. CDEL has sold its technology park, Global Village, in Bengaluru. Blackstone and southern developer Salarpuria Sattva bought it for Rs 2,700 crore.
A major part of the sale proceeds would be used to bring down debt, the board told shareholders. Global Village is a 4 million sqft tenanted space located on a 120-acre campus.
After Siddhartha sold 21% stake in Mindtree to L&T for Rs 3,200 crore in May, the proceeds net of expenses and tax to the tune of Rs 2,100 crore has been utilised to pare debt.
TOI has reported previously that global private equity majors KKR, TPG Capital and Bain Capital are among investors who have signed a non-disclosure agreement to evaluate a potential share purchase in CDEL's flagship venture Cafe Coffee Day."

Captain Amit Verma was named Man-of-the Match for his career best figures of 6-52 and 89 in the first innings. Manipur were bowled out for 88 in 42.4 overs in the second innings to hand Goa a bonus point. Goa scored 553-5 (declared) after dismissing Manipur for 106 in the first innings.
Goa have now moved to second in the table with 24 points. They defeated Sikkim, Meghalaya and Manipur, and drew against Bihar. Goa will travel to Puducherry to play the table toppers on January 11. Puducherry are on top with 27 points.
Four wickets down and trailing by 426 runs, Manipur failed to build any partnership. Verma opted for spin and it was the captain who took the first wicket, getting rid of Jayanta Sagatpam LBW on 6. Ajay Lamabam (4) returned to the pavilion after getting caught plumb in front of left-arm orthodox spinner Amulya Pandrekar.
Manipur were reduced to 6-30 and it got worse when they lost the seventh wicket of Karam Dharmendra (0) bowled off Verma.
It looked like the match won't even last an hour. However, allrounder Rex Rajkumar and Kangabam Singh put up some resistance. Rex (21) was harsh on spinners and Goa were happy to let him play attacking shots. He hit four boundaries before trying to cut left arm-orthodox Darshan Misal, edging to wicketkeeper Smit Patel.
Knowing newcomer Thomas Moirangthem would play defensive strokes, Darshan darted in a straight one. The umpire immediately raised his finger the moment the ball hit the pad to send him back to the pavilion.
Darshan took three wickets for 13 runs. Last-man Bishworjit Singh, known for his only-attack attitude, survived the hat-trick ball and another one.
Meanwhile, Kangabam lost his concentration and went for a wild swing off Verma, only top-edging to Vijesh Prabhudessai to mark the end of the match.

Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Friday, sparking fears of a new war in the Middle East.
The Pakistan Foreign Office said that Qureshi held telephonic conversations with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE and Turkey to discuss the regional situation unfolding in the region.
""The Foreign Minister reaffirmed that Pakistan would neither let its soil be used against any other State nor become part of any regional conflict,"" the Foreign Office (FO) said.
Highlighting Pakistan's deep concern over the recent developments, Qureshi underscored the imperative of avoiding conflict, exercise of maximum restraint, and de-escalation of tensions.
He called on all parties concerned to abide by the UN Charter and principles of international law to settle differences through peaceful means.
Sharing Pakistan's perspective, the foreign minister expressed hope that the progress made in the Afghan peace process would be preserved and advanced further.
He reiterated Pakistan's readiness to continue to play a role in preventing further escalation and maintaining regional peace and stability, the FO said.
Hundreds of protesters, including women and children, rallied in Karachi and Islamabad to protest the killing of Soleimani.
The rallies organised by Shiite groups - including Imamia Students Organisation (ISO), Jaafria Alliance, Majlis-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM), Tanzeem Azadari and Shia Ulema Council - chanted anti-American slogans.
The protestor, carrying portraits of Soleimani and chanting slogans like ""Down with USA!"", were stopped by police from moving toward the US consulate.
The protest rally in Islamabad started from the National Press Club and ended at the D-Chowk in front of Parliament. It was led by Shiite leader Allama Syed Ali Rizvi and women and children took part in the protest.
Pakistan has the biggest Shiite population after Iran and may face turbulence in case of a war between the US and Iran.
The country, in the past, has tried to maintain a balance between Saudi Arabia and Iran which are regional rivals.
The US Embassy in Islamabad already on Friday issued a countrywide security alert, warning its employees and US citizens to restrict their movement.
""Given possible reactions to recent events in Iraq, the US Embassy has restricted travel by US government employees. US government personnel in Pakistan are required to postpone non-essential official movements and most personal movements. US citizens in Pakistan should monitor their surroundings for possible demonstrations and suspicious activity,"" the embassy said in a statement."

But US civilians should not be targeted, he said, because this would serve the agenda of President Trump. Founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, Lebanese group Hezbollah is key part of an Iranian-backed regional military alliance."

"Vinod Kumar | TNN | Updated: Jan 7, 2020, 11:47 IST",Vinod Kumar,City,Centre nod for Punjab’s ayurvedic rehab centre,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab has become first state in the country to get a government-run Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre.
The Union ministry of Ayush has approved the Punjab government's proposal to start an Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre, which will come up at Amritsar's Ayurvedic government hospital.
The ministry has sanctioned a grant of Rs 1.5 crore for the project, which it aims to replicate in other parts of the country.
The development assumes significance as Punjab is grappling with the problem of drug abuse and is home to about 7.2 lakh addicts. The Centre will give much-needed alternative treatment options to the addicts who at present are being treated with opioid substitution therapy (OST) by giving buprenorphine.
Confirming the development, Dr Manoj Nesari, joint adviser (Ayurveda), Ayush, said Punjab's proposal has been accepted and it is the first state where such an initiative has been taken. To work out the modalities, the ministry held series of meeting with the Punjab government officials, including the chief secretary.
Sharing details, Dr Nesari stated treatment protocol, which focuses on treating patients through Ayurvedic medicines, yoga, exercises, meditation and counselling, has been prepared by a team of doctors led by Dr Rakesh Sharma, director, Ayurveda, Punjab, in consultation with the Ayush ministry.
As per the treatment protocol, patients will be admitted to the hospital for a period of three months. After they are discharged, regular follow-ups at short intervals will be done for six months to avoid relapse.
Five-step panchkarma therapies for mind and body rejuvenation, yoga and meditation sessions and psychological counselling of all the patients is part of the treatment protocol.
""Addiction is a mental problem and Ayurveda has a lot of potential to treat addiction,"" said Dr Nesari, who had in past run a similar programme in a Mumbai-based hospital. The Punjab health department will purchase medicines and these will be provided free of cost to the addicts.
Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre will provide alternative treatment to addicts which has no side effects. ""Depending upon the success of the project, there is plan to open more such centres in the state,"" said Sidhu.
APPLIED FOR LICENCE
Punjab Ayurveda department has initiated the process for obtaining licence required to run the de-addiction centre. The licence is issued by the health department.
THE ACTION PLAN
The patients will be put on treatment after diagnosis on basis of history and symptoms, such as body aches (Sharirdukha), hallucinations (arupanaamstam darshnam), thirst (trishna), anorexia (aruchi), lassitude (sharm), delirium (sammoh), yawning (jambhai), palpitations (safuran), trembling (vepanm), and loss of sleep (prajagr).
CHALLENGE AT HAND
The ill-effects of addiction to drugs like opium and cannabis have been described in Ayurveda. However, there is no description of hazards of semi-synthetic\synthetic drugs derived from natural or chemical sources in Ayurveda."

Orange alert has been issued for eight districts of Himachal Pradesh
Fresh spell of rain and snow has further intensified cold conditions in Himachal Pradesh. Many parts of state received rain and snow on Monday, plummeting the temperature further.
According to Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh, a fresh Western Disturbance has approached the state whose impact would be visible for next two days — Tuesday and Wednesday. He said heavy snowfall is expected in the higher reaches of Shimla, Sirmaur, Mandi, Chamba and Kangra and Kullu districts beside Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti during next two days. Besides, middle and low hills of the state will witness rain and hailstorm during next two.

Shimla deputy commissioner Amit Kashyap said all roads in Shimla urban area were open for vehicular traffic and have even been covered with sand to avoid any untoward incident. He said snow clearing operations were going on a war-footing on Dhalli-Kufri, Kufri-Chail, Mashobra-Bhekalti, Shimla-Theog roads, which are blocked due to snowfall. The district administration has deployed adequate JCB machinery to ensure smooth traffic flow at the earliest.
Kashyap said snow clearing work on roads was on at Khadapathar, Tikkar, Khadrala, Sungri and Chopal areas. He added that HRTC buses were not plying in snowbound upper Shimla areas and were taking Basantpur route for Rampur.
He said there was adequate stock of essential commodities in the far-flung areas of the district including Dodra Kwar subdivision and there was no need for any panic.
Over 300 tourist vehicles were stranded in Solang valley, between Solang and Kulang village, late on Monday evening after the vehicles started slipping on snow.
The road between Kulang and Solang is covered under 10-25cm of snow and snowfall was still continuing in the area. The road became slippery due to heavy snow and vehicles started skidding.
Even as snow is accumulating on the highway at a very fast rate, police were confident that all vehicles would be moved to safety.
Mild cold conditions prevailed in Punjab after overnight rains. Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded their respective lows at 8.2 degrees Celsius, 10 degrees Celsius and 10.7 degrees Celsius, up to five degrees above the normal.

"Bharti Jain, Atul Mathur & Alok KN Mishra | TNN | Updated: Jan 7, 2020, 10:30 IST",Bharti Jain,India,Delhi elections 2020: BJP banks on Modi magic to counter Kejriwal charisma,"NEW DELHI: The gong has been struck for a three-way showdown between AAP, BJP and Congress with the Election Commission announcing assembly polls in Delhi for February 8 even as turmoil over violence during anti-CAA protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and Sunday's attack on JNU students roils politics.
The results, despite a usually limited role of ""national"" issues in state polls, will be seen as a verdict on recent incidents that have seen BJP and its opponents clash over allegations of ""majoritarianism"" and ""intolerance"" with regard to violence on campuses and legislations like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).
Electioneering promises to be heated and hectic as CM Arvind Kejriwal looks to retain the AAP fort after finishing behind Congress in the Lok Sabha polls. For BJP, the challenge is to regain a turf it held only once and reverse a trend of setbacks in state polls where regional and local factors seem to prevail over national issues.
With polling on February 8, results will be declared on February 11. Announcing the schedule on Monday, CEC Sunil Arora, along with EC Ashok Lavasa, said over 1.47 crore voters are eligible to vote on 70 assembly seats. The polls will be notified on January 14, nominations can be filed until January 21 and withdrawn by January 24.

The current Delhi assembly expires on February 22. The last assembly election in 2015 delivered a massive landslide win for AAP, which won 67 seats, leaving only three for BJP. Congress, which was in power for 15 years before that, drew a blank.
With polls announced in the midst of continuing anti-CAA protests in some parts of Delhi and Sunday evening's violence at JNU, the CEC, responding to a question on law and order, said, ""I won't say we (the commission) are very sanguine, but we are hopeful that they (police) will be able to control the situation (and make it) conducive for polls."" He added that in an extraordinary situation, the EC had the power to defer polls.
After having failed to expand beyond Delhi and further losing its gains in Punjab in the May 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a defeat for AAP will be a severe setback. But as of now, it enjoys frontrunner status as Kejirwal engages in a major public outreach over populist initiatives and claims of a significant improvement in areas like education.
On the other hand, scandals and resignations have hurt his government that has lost the campaigning aura it had in 2014 when it was born from the Anna Hazare movement.

AAP will hope differentiations between state and national polls will work in its favour and Kejriwal has also changed his earlier tactic of attacking PM Narendra Modi and clashing with the Centre over a range of issues. BJP hopes that AAP will not have the benefit of the extraordinary surge that powered it to 67 seats and is reaching out to unauthorised colonies and slums with its regularisation plans and a promise of faster development.
Congress is the third player in the game and did surprise by pushing AAP to third place in the Lok Sabha polls. There is, however, concern over its organisational health post Sheila Dikshit, who had been a popular chief minister over three consecutive terms. Also, while in the Lok Sabha polls, it was seen as a contender at the Centre by anti-BJP voters, the case might be different in state elections where AAP is looking to consolidate minority votes - a section both parties are fiercely competing for.
A favourable outcome will help BJP reverse the trend of setbacks in state polls. It will bank on the vote getting ability of its mascot, Modi, and hope efforts to get city heavyweights to pull along sees the party put up a more united front than has been the case for several years. Replicating the 55% vote share in the Lok Sabha elections is a tough task and Congress's performance may influence outcomes.
Kejriwal said his party was ready for the ""battle"" and exuded confidence that it would be reelected even as home minister Amit Shah took on AAP, claiming that it had failed to deliver on several fronts. The chief minister said elections would be a referendum on the work of the AAP government.
""Vote for us if you think that we have done work. If we haven't, don't vote for us,"" he said.
The model code of conduct has kicked in and will apply to candidates, political parties and Delhi government, besides the Union government in so far as announcements and policy decisions pertaining to NCT of Delhi. It will not affect the Union budget 2020-21 on February 1.
The EC had, in a ruling on January 23, 2017, in view of polls in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur, directed that ""in the interest of free fair elections and in order to maintain level playing field during elections, no state-specific schemes shall be announced in the national budget, which may have the effect of influencing electors of the five poll-going states in favour of the ruling party"".
For the first time in Delhi and second after the Jharkhand polls, senior citizens above 80 and physically challenged voters can vote from home using the postal ballot facility. While the pilot project in Jharkhand covered only seven constituencies, the EC will now extend this across all 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi.
AAP is projecting Kejriwal, who overshadows everything and everyone in the party. Out of office since 1998, when it lost to Congress, BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari said people have ""seen through"" the lies of AAP in the last five years and made up their mind to give chance to the saffron fold."

They are scanning footage from main gate cameras, but that may yield little as the goons are unlikely to have entered from there. Cops are also using face recognition software to identify the attackers.


Even as the violence was unfolding, cops were filing two FIRs that named JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and others following complaints from JNU about its server room being damaged on Friday and Saturday. No one has been named as accused yet.
Under intense media and public glare, the cops have started analysing a list of over 10,000 mobile numbers active in and around Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday. They aim to eliminate students, university staffers, guards and residents of the area in order to identify the 'outsiders' who indulged in violence.
JNU violence: Viral video fact check leaves ABVP red-faced

Meanwhile, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar took recourse to some wordplay when asked at a press conference who the ""masked men"" who perpetrated the mayhem could be. He said that some students who have been protesting against the fee hike and earlier attacked him had come with ""masked faces"" and damaged the data centre - which appears to be an attempt to blame the Left-affiliated Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU). What the administration is at a loss to explain is why the students' union would attack its own president.
Delhi Police on Tuesday issued a public appeal for helping in identifying the suspects. They said: ""A special investigating team (SIT) of the crime branch, headed by DCP Joy Tirkey, is investigating the case. All those who are witnesses to the incident or have information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera are hereby requested to come forward and give their statements/footage/picture in their possession to the SIT at admin block, JNU campus, New Delhi...within seven days."" Contact numbers have also been provided.
Earlier in the day, the police served notices on some staffers of the university, asking them to join the investigations. They are questioning wardens and other employees to piece together the actual sequence of events on Sunday. Forensic experts were called in to lift fingerprints and other evidence from the spot. The team visited the hostels to talk to students but found most rooms locked. Statements of some of the injured students have been recorded. The police team has been given a room at the administrative block to conduct the investigations.
A senior police officer said that their initial probe has revealed that clashes on the JNU campus took place in four phases - the last two being the most violent - through Sunday. The first clash, according to them, took place near School of Social Sciences and the second near the administrative block at noon. The last two happened at Periyar and Sabarmati hostels in the evening.
Another team, led by joint commissioner (western range) Shalini Singh, who is heading a fact-finding committee that is to submit a report to the home ministry, also visited the university on Tuesday and recorded the statements of staffers and the security guards who had been attacked.
The police have also questioned Pinky Chaudhary, head of the so-called Hindu Raksha Dal, who has claimed responsibility for the attack on students and teachers. Though no evidence was found against the outfit, police say that they will still be under probe.
Meanwhile, Delhi Police have received three more complaints from a professor and two JNU students which are being looked into."

"TNN | Updated: Jan 8, 2020, 13:52 IST",null,null,Forecast puts GDP growth at 11-year low of 5%,"NEW DELHI: The economy is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in 11 years in 2019-20, dragged down by anaemic manufacturing, slowing services sector growth, as well as sluggish investment and consumption. With the Union Budget less than a month away, the dismal forecast will add pressure on the authorities to revive the economy.
The National Statistical Office on Tuesday forecast GDP growth to be 5% in 2019-20, slower than the previous year's 6.8% and in line with the RBI estimate. If this growth is realised, then it would be the slowest since 3.1% posted in 2008-09 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Nominal GDP, which is the market value of goods and services produced in the economy but not adjusted for inflation, is estimated to grow at a42-year low of 7.5%.
Manufacturing is estimated to slow to 2% in 2019-20 from 6.9% the previous year while the services sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of the economy, is forecast to grow by 6.9%, slower than 7.5% in the previous year.

GDP data points to weak investment in FY20
Economists said there is a sharp decline in the growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) from 10% in FY19 (revised estimate) to 1% in FY20 (advance estimate), reflecting the subdued investment activity in the economy.
""These numbers must be read with caution as the methodology clearly says that these are extrapolations of the existing data on various sectors which could range from 6 months to 8 months. Therefore there is scope for change in these numbers when the actual numbers are reckoned,' said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings referring to the overall numbers.

The lower nominal growth is also expected to upset the government's fiscal calculations. ""For FY20 the budgeted nominal GDP growth rate was 12% which has now been revised downwards to 7.5%. Based on this GDP revision, the impact on the fiscal deficit is around 12 basis points (100 basis points equal a percentage point) for FY20,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI.
The government aims to rein in the fiscal deficit at 3.3% of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year but the pressure on revenues may widen the deficit. There have been calls for relaxing the deficit target to provide space for stimulus to the economy but the government has so far maintained that it will stick to the path of fiscal consolidation.
Economists said demand drivers such as private consumption, investment and net exports are down with the exception of government expenditure. ""The growth slowdown especially in private consumption to 5.8% in FY20 from 8.1% in FY19 has taken the sting out of FY20 GDP growth because this alone constitutes 57.4% of the total GDP,"" said Sunil Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research.
""We believe that the advance estimates of 5% GDP growth is not sacrosanct. There are risks,"" he said."
"TNN | Jan 8, 2020, 01:16 IST",null,India,Panel gives green signal to 150 private trains on 100 routes,"NEW DELHI: A high-powered panel has cleared the road for rolling out nearly 150 private trains on 100 routes, including Mumbai-Delhi and Howrah-Delhi sectors, which will compete with Rajdhani.
While two Tejas trains have been handed over for running by Railways-controlled IRCTC on the Delhi-Lucknow and Mumbai-Ahmedabad routes as an experiment with the ""private sector"", the committee's report is likely to pave the way for a massive competition to the services currently being offered by the state transporter.
The panel was set up by minister Piyush Goyal after Railway Board chairman VK Yadav flagged off private trains in the Centre's 100 days' agenda.
The recommendations put out for stakeholder consultations have proposed that Indian as well as global players, with experience in railway and tourism sectors be permitted, provided they have a minimum net worth of Rs 450 crore. Other performance parameters, like a maximum-permissible 15-minute delay, beyond which passengers will have to be compensated, have been proposed. On IRCTC-run Tejas trains, a similar facility has been offered.

The routes have been divided into seven clusters with a clear plan to develop infrastructure in less utilised stations such as Panvel near Mumbai and Tilak Bridge and Okhla in Delhi for running long-distance trains.
The train routes have been primarily identified on Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Kolkata routes as the railways is hopeful of freeing up tracks by December 2021, when both Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors will become fully operational and take over the burden of handling goods traffic. The railways has also approved the plan to improve the existing tracks on these two routes to allow trains to run at 160 kmph, which has been proposed as the speed limit for private trains.
According to the plan, the time taken by a train to complete a journey will be comparable with the fastest train operated by the Indian Railways on that route. And, to provide comfort to private players, the railways will not run regular trains on the same route within 15 minutes of the scheduled operation of the private train.
Private operators will be free to fix the fare, decide on halts and procure coaches and engines from any source as long as they comply with the railways' standards. The private players will have to deploy all the trains within five years of award of contract.
The idea is to offer better quality service on these trains, while also seeking investments, estimated at over Rs 22,000 crore, for the railways to reverse the trend of losing passenger traffic to airlines. And, the plan is to move in swiftly with the panel headed by NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant suggesting that the first train can be rolled out within six months of the award, with 35-year contracts to be awarded to entities offering to pay the highest revenue share.
According to government data, the current railway network is about 68,000 route km.
In 2018-19, the reserved passenger volume was 16% (590 million) of the total originating non-suburban passengers and almost 8.85 crore of wait-listed passengers could not be accommodated.
""There is hence a critical requirement to introduce private operations in passenger train which will allow introduction of next-generation technology , ensuring use of improved coach technology and reduced journey time,"" an official document said justifying the need to allow private players to run trains."

"Marcus Mergulhao | Jan 9, 2020, 00:26 IST",Marcus Mergulhao,City,Indian Super League loses its only marquee player,"Margao:NorthEast United FC have been dealt a huge blow with news that their star player Asamoah Gyan will have no further role to play in the Indian Super League (ISL).
Gyan, the only marquee player in this edition of the ISL, is understood to have picked up a grade 2 injury in training last week and has been ruled out for rest of the season.
According to team sources, NorthEast’s leading goal-scorer will need a minimum of eight weeks to recover, and by that time the ISL would be over.
“Yes, Gyan is injured unfortunately. He cannot play. It’s finished for him and I think in one or two days, we will have two new players,” said NorthEast United coach Robert Jarni after his side lost 0-2 against FC Goa at Fatorda on Wednesday.
A legend in Africa, the Ghanaian has featured in a record four World Cups and remains the highest scorer from Africa in the tournament's history with six goals.
With Gyan injured, Maximiliano Barreiro returning home due to family emergencies and Panagiotis Triadis contracted only till December – before Frederico Gallego filled the void – coach Jarni didn’t have much of a choice as he fielded four foreign players and pulled out Gallego in the second session to leave NorthEast with only three internationals.
Team sources said at least one new foreign player will be in Goa on Thursday itself."
"FLAVIO LOPES | Jan 9, 2020, 00:27 IST",FLAVIO LOPES,City,ISL: FC Goa move to the top,"Margao: FC Goa were made to sweat before scripting a 2-0 victory over NorthEast United FC in a Indian Super League (ISL) clash at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Wednesday.
The home team struggled in the first half and needed a bit of luck in the second when NorthEast’s Croatian defender Mislav Komorski scored an own-goal. Ferran Corominas then converted a penalty after Leudo Romana was sent off in the 80th minute as the visitors were reduced to 10 men.
FC Goa’s win – their 100th match in the league across six seasons –helped them regain the top spot. They are now on 24 points from 12 matches and will travel to face second placed ATK (21 points) in a crucial encounter on January 18.
NorthEast remained eighth with 11 points, but have a game in hand.
FC Goa head coach Sergio Lobera was back on the sidelines after serving a one-match suspension where his side lost 1-2 to defending champions Bengaluru. The Spaniard doesn’t really like to surprise his opponents and fielded his usually predictable strongest starting 11.
The home side enjoyed superior ball possession from the start and build up confidence with every pass. Most of their moves came from the right where winger Jackichand Singh, Hugo Boumous and star striker Coro linked up on several occasions.
But they failed to pose a real threat to goalkeeper Pawan Kumar, who started ahead of first choice custodian Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, serving a suspension.
NorthEast head coach Robert Jarni knew how his opponents function having played a 2-2 draw in the first leg in Guwahati. The visitors started with only four foreigners with Ghanaian World Cupper Asamoah Gyan unavailable, and adopted defensive tactics. Captain Federico Gallego went forward occasionally in his first start of the season and never troubled goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz.
At the other end, Coro came close with a bicycle kick while Carlos Pena’s half volley went wide. Before the break, Hugo tricked Reagan and moved dangerously but his cross was collected by Pawan before Coro could do any damage.
Just two minutes into the second session, Goa had a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock. However, with only Pawan to beat, Jackichand aimed straight at the goalkeeper, and Brandon Fernandes’ rebound was cleared on the line by defender Reagan Singh.
In the 68th minute, however, Jackichand made amends. Hugo played the ball to the Manipuri winger and he attempted a cross which Croatian centre-back Mislav Komorski guided into his own net.
Goa were determined to score more and waited patiently. In the 79th minute, Ahmed Jahouh flicked over a delightful ball in the path of Coro and he was brought down in the box by Leudo Romana. The Colombian was sent off and Coro converted the penalty with ease for his eighth goal of the season to put him back on top of the goalscorers chart alongside ATK’s Roy Krishna."
"TNN | Updated: Jan 9, 2020, 10:27 IST",null,City,"Not the best show but three points matter, says FC Goa coach Sergio Lobera","MARGAO: Not everything went according to Sergio Lobera’s script, but there was still so much to cheer as FC Goa played their 100th match in the Indian Super League (ISL).
FC Goa struggled to breakdown a defensive NorthEast United FC and needed an own goal to break their resolve. Ferran Corominas then won a late penalty and converted himself to move to the top of the goalscoring chart with his eighth goal, and 49th overall.
This was also Goa’s 50th home game and coincidentally Coro’s strike was the 100th goal at Fatorda. The number that mattered the most, though, were the three points that took Goa back to the top of the table with 24 points.
Goa have now opened a three-point lead at the top of the table, and even though they’ve played an extra game, Lobera should be pleased with the progress, never mind the sluggishness against NorthEast.
“I think we played a difficult match because NorthEast played very well. It’s difficult for us to find spaces. But the most important thing for us is to get three points and go to top of the table,” said Lobera.
Handicapped by the absence of key players like Asamoah Gyan and Kai Heerings, the visitors adopted a defensive approach, something Lobera was ready for.
“I think NorthEast are missing two very important players. NorthEast with Gyan is a different team. I did not know before the match that they would not play these two players. I spoke to my players before the game. Against Kerala, NorthEast played in the same way that they did today. They defended with the whole team in their half,” said the Spanish coach.
Lobera has now turned his focus to ATK in what could be a decisive game in the League title race.
“They are a strong team with very good players. I expect a very difficult match. But I look at the players in my team and believe that it is possible to win this game. We need some time now. We have 10 days to prepare. I hope when we go to Kolkata, we get three points. The three points will be a big step for us with only five matches (left) to be played,” said Lobera."

"Saurabh Sinha | TNN | Updated: Jan 9, 2020, 08:09 IST",Saurabh Sinha,null,Flights to get longer as carriers avoid Iran airspace,"NEW DELHI: Flying time between India and the west - Europe and the Americas - will increase by up to 40 minutes with several airlines deciding to avoid overflying the Iranian airspace to steer clear of the US-Iran conflict zone in West Asia. The increase will be about 20 minutes for flights to and from Delhi and almost double for Mumbai.
Airlines have not yet indicated if the increased flying time, that means higher operational expenses on fuel burn and other factors like crew, will lead to a fare hike. ""Let us see how long it continues. If it remains for long, we will have to pass on the expense to passengers,"" said an airline official.

Iran launched missile attacks on bases housing American troops in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday (local time Iran). Immediately after that, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred its carriers from overflying the airspace of Iran, Iraq and the waters of Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman as there is a ""potential for miscalculation or mis-identification"" that could endanger safety of civilian aircraft. The order was instantly applicable to all American airline and US-registered aircraft.
A few hours later, DGCA ""directed"" Indian carriers to ""to take appropriate precautionary measures including rerouting their flights [from affected airspaces] in order to ensure complete safety of passengers.""
Accordingly, Air India - the only Indian carrier currently flying to mainland Europe, the UK, US and Canada - and AI Express said they will not overfly Iran. Other big airlines like Lufthansa, Swiss, Air France and KLM said they won't be doing so either.
American carriers United and Delta, which have direct flights between the US and Delhi and Mumbai, are barred from overflying that conflict zone by FAA's notice to airmen (Notam).
""In light of the tensions within the Iranian airspace a decision to temporarily reroute flights of AI and AI Express overflying Iran has been taken,"" AI spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said.
The longer route will mean flights from India to the west will fly to Pakistan, towards Afghanistan and then go further up north to steer clear of Iranian airspace. The saving grace for all airlines is that Pakistan airspace is open.
Other countries were to take their own call, though most usually follow US Notams.
Flight tracking sites show a Mumbai-London and Bengaluru-London commercial flight were among those en route that had to divert after the FAA Notam. ""Two AI flights were in Iran airspace at that time and they continued safely to their destinations,"" said an official."

Bengaluru’s student population, which has until now been restrained from voicing out political opinions, took to social media to protest this latest development.
A day later, on January 9, 2020, when the students of JNC set out to hold a protest against the incidents of the day before, they were forced to stop two minutes after they began their peaceful protest. A student from the college informed us, “I do not know what is happening. We have been asked not to leave the campus; authorities have asked all students to remain indoors.” Teachers and college authorities refrained from commenting at the time of going to press. “We have been asked not to divulge any details until further notice,” said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

"Sindhu Hariharan | TNN | Updated: Jan 10, 2020, 11:18 IST",Sindhu Hariharan,null,"India lost $1.3 billion due to 4,196 hours of no internet","CHENNAI: Internet shutdowns in India are not just disruptions in routine and individual freedom, but are also having an economic impact on the country. Around 4,196 hours of internet blackouts in India cost the economy close to $1.3 billion in 2019, finds a study by UK-based tech research firm Top10Vpn.
India was the third worst-hit economy worldwide after crisis-hit Iraq and Sudan thanks to state-imposed shut downs across Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, UP and other regions, shows the report. An average of 8.4 million internet users were impacted across the multiple incidents, it said.
The economic impact is likely to be higher, the study adds, given that the study only assessed large region-wide blackouts and India's smaller and more localised shutdowns weren't included.

""There were more internet shutdowns in 2019 than ever before,"" Samuel Woodhams and Simon Migliano, authors of the report by Top10Vpn told TOI in an email. ""As for India, the frequency of disruptions still far surpasses any other country we analysed and, unless swift action is taken to reduce the number and duration of disruptions, the economic impact is likely to continue to rise,"" they added.
The vast majority of internet shutdowns in India in 2019 were highly localised and short-lived, but the costliest disruption occurred in Kashmir, where the shutdown remains ongoing.
""The shutdown in Kashmir is one of the longest internet shutdowns to have ever occurred and cost the Indian economy nearly $1.1 billion in 2019,"" Woodhams and Migliano said. It has hurt the economy, impacted local healthcare services, freedom of the press and education in the region.
The clampdown of internet services in the northeast in relation to the Citizenship Amendment Act resulted in around $102 million of economic impact, and the restrictions in Uttar Pradesh led to a $63 million hit."

RInfra will utilise the proceeds to reduce debt.
""Reliance Infrastructure has received the in-principle approval for Harmonious Substitution in the Delhi-Agra (DA) toll road project on January 7 from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)... Reliance Infrastructure will receive an enterprise value of Rs 3,600 crore including equity of up to Rs 1,700 crore,"" the RInfra official said.
This approval paves the way to close the sale of the 180-km 6-lane Delhi-Agra toll road to Cube Highways and Infrastructure III Pte Ltd, which is owned by a Singapore-based Global Infrastructure Fund, I Squared Capital, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the official said.
The entire proceeds will be used by Reliance Infrastructure to pay lenders and reduce the debt of the company, the official said.
This is in line with the commitment made by Reliance Infrastructure to its 16 lenders on July 6, 2019, when lenders signed an inter-creditor agreement for resolution of debt and granted moratorium to the company on the interest and principal payments.
Reliance Infrastructure, which has a total debt of Rs 6,000 crore, is on track to reduce leverage even further as it focuses to be an asset- and capital-light entity, the company had said in September last year.
Addressing the shareholders at the company's annual general meeting, its chairman Anil Ambani had said, ""Our intent is to reduce the debt further. At present, we have around Rs 6,000 crore of debt but with a large networth,"" adding that the company will focus on the domestic market and take up more complex infrastructure and transportation projects."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June last year received an anonymous complaint alleging insurance plans recommended by Maruti while selling cars resulted in customers paying more compared with other options in the market. Based on the complaint, the CCI is assessing whether Maruti has engaged in so-called ""tie-in arrangements"", in which a car maker promotes preferred suppliers of complementary goods such as lubricants or insurance, the sources said.
Indian law says such practices are anti-competitive if they end up stifling competition and limiting consumer choices. The Commission is looking into the complaint and ""it will take a while"", said one of the two sources, who declined to be named as the case details are private.
In response to Reuters questions, a Maruti spokesman said, ""We are not aware of any such alleged complaint that is being investigated by CCI and therefore cannot comment on the same.""

"TNN | Updated: Jan 10, 2020, 12:39 IST",null,null,'Sterling & Wilson must offer small investors exit',"BENGALURU: Proxy advisory firm InGovern Research has come out with a report on Sterling & Wilson Solar. It has asked promoters Shapoorji Pallonji Group to provide an exit option for minority shareholders, citing the change in schedule debt repayments from the proceeds of the IPO, which was an offer for sale by the promoters.
InGovern said minority shareholders have lost Rs 1,700 crore as the share price has slipped from Rs 780 to Rs 310 as of January 6 this year. It added that the company's board and audit committee should be held liable for failure to protect the public shareholders.
Sterling and Wilson hit back at the report, calling it ""malicious, misleading, defamatory"" and adding that ""sensationalism in this report is more an attempt to further erode investor wealth"".
The development comes at a time when SP Group's Cyrus Mistry has questioned corporate governance at Tata Sons after an NCLAT ruling came in his favour last month.
Sterling and Wilson was listed in August 2019 as the largest public offering last year, fetching SP Group promoters Rs 2,850 crore. According to the prospectus, of the total amount, Rs 2,563 crore was to be used to pay inter-corporate debt by November 18 to make the company debt-free. But the SP Group missed the payments due to the liquidity crisis and has now come up with a new schedule to pay the amount in three more tranches by September 2020. It paid Rs 1,000 crore by December 31, with the remaining amount yet to be paid.
""In this case, where shareholders have suffered significant erosion in value of their holdings solely due to non-utilisation of funds as per the objects of offer of the IPO, Sebi must force the promoters to provide an exit offer to shareholders at a price as per Sebi (ICDR) Regulations,"" InGovern said. It added that minority shareholders have a strong case in their hands if they file a class-action suit.
Sterling and Wilson has countered by saying that the promoters were under ""no obligation to mention the utilisation of proceeds"" and there is no legal default. The company board ""levied additional interest of 100 basis points"" because of rescheduling in payments and ""it is illogical to link the stock price reduction"" just to the delay in payment. Sterling and Wilson share price closed at Rs 322, up by about 5% on NSE on Thursday."

"Mohammed Wajihudin | TNN | Updated: Jan 12, 2020, 01:03 IST",Mohammed Wajihudin,India,110 pilgrims stopped from boarding Iraq flight in Mumbai,"MUMBAI: A total of 110 Indian passengers, all Dawoodi Bohra pilgrims headed to holy shrines in Iraq, were stopped by immigration officials at the Mumbai international airport from boarding a 2.30am Iraqi Airways flight to Najaf on Saturday. Five of them had already cleared immigration checks and the others were on their way to the immigration counters after having got their boarding passes when the incident took place.
Those who had cleared immigration were brought back from the boarding gates as airport officials asked the airline to stop issuing passes post-midnight, apparently after receiving instructions that travel to Iraq was ""unsafe"" for Indians.
A January 8 circular from the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said it had suspended immigration clearance to passengers travelling to Iraq. ""Immigration clearance for Iraq to both ECR (immigration clearance required) and ECNR (immigration clearance not required) passport holders ( sic) immigrants is not to be given with immediate effect till further orders,"" the letter stated. Aviation regulator DGCA had also advised all Indian carriers to avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and the waters of Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman in view of heightened tensions in the Middle East.
Additional commissioner of police, special branch II, Supriya Patil-Yadav, told TOI, ""An instruction from MHA said travelling to Iraq is unsafe. We had to stop the passengers from boarding the flight. With a fluid situation, safety of Indians is priority.""
However, immigration officials at Ahmedabad airport had stopped passengers from travelling to Iraq on Thursday, a day after the MEA notice. Passengers there were informed on phone and spared the ordeal of reaching the airport, while those from Mumbai said they had to wait at the airport until 4am to get their already checked-in luggage back.

Families of those who got immigration cancellation stamps said they were worried questions might be raised in future at the time of obtaining security clearances, especially for travel to many Western countries.
An aviation industry source said immigration authorities have stopped all airlines going to Najaf and Karbala from taking Indian passengers.
Iraqi Airways Flight IA 442, which the pilgrims were to take, flies from Mumbai to Najaf twice a week (Tuesday and Saturday) and from Ahmedabad on Thursday and Sunday. Iraqi Airways alone operates between Mumbai and Najaf; half a dozen flights of other carriers to Iraq from Mumbai via Dubai and Sharjah have stopped flying to Najaf and Baghdad.
A senior official at Iraqi Airways said until 11.30pm on Friday, immigration officials kept saying they would clear passengers going to Iraq, so most passengers were issued boarding passes. ""They kept talking to higher officials in Mumbai and Delhi and one senior officer told us to take an undertaking from passengers that they were travelling at their own risk. We got passengers to sign this undertaking. But then suddenly we were told they would not be allowed to travel,"" said the airline official, requesting anonymity.
Some pilgrims who were apprehensive over the past few days about whether they would get to go at all said they were told by the airline that if they failed to report to the airport in time, they would not get a refund either. ""My wife and I took a flight from Indore, where we live, to Mumbai to reach the airport in time, only to discover we were blocked,"" said Abdeali Rangwala.
Abuzar Sakharwala, another passenger who, along with his wife, reached the airport at 10.30pm on Friday, said most passengers had checked in when they were informed of instructions from immigration officials not to proceed further. ""We had to suffer so much because we were not informed in time,"" Sakharwala said."

In a chat with us, the Ankhon Dekhi actor shared his musical journey which began from the city, his experience of performing in Lucknow and the reason why he has been missing from films and television. Having been part of the hit show Sumit Sambhal Lega and many other TV shows and films, Namit has been missing from films and television for quite a long time now. Sharing the reason for the same, the Lafangey Parindey actor says, “I have been travelling a lot for Monsoon Wedding, The Musical, a theatre project for which I am associated with Mira Nair for three years now. So, I have been away from the country for quite a long time. Probably the last thing you have seen me in was Sui Dhaaga and Pataakha in 2018. After that, I have been doing ads whenever I was here, so things keep happening for me.”
The Bombay Talkies actor is the son of ghazal singer Chandan Dass and started his musical journey from a theatre festival in the city in the year 2015 and has performed here twice since. Ask him how has been his musical journey been so far and he shares, “It has been great, although it has been very challenging as well because the kind of music I play and the people it caters to, is a niche audience.”

Namit adds, “But having said that, we have been doing music for five years now with my band and we have almost completed all of the indie circuits now. And we are looking to launch our new album this year, and we will soon start working on it, depending upon the time I get from my commitments. So, it has been a great musical journey so far.” Talking about the experience of performing in Lucknow twice, Namit shares, “Essentially, what I sing is poetry and the language I sing in, Lucknowites understand that very well, and that is Urdu. It was a great response from the city’s audience. I have never ever seen an audience that not only just listens to the music but also listens to the words and the atmosphere which is being created by the music. For Lucknowites, words matter and it actually affects them, which is rare to find anywhere else in the country.”
Namit has been to the city several times before, quiz him what he likes the most about the city and he is prompt to reply, “Ittr (perfume)! I just love the ittr in Lucknow. In fact I have gone crazy for a particular brand of ittr, a part of me has gone mad for it. I have a private collection of ittr now.” He adds, “Apart from that, I love the people of Lucknow, they are so loving, caring and generous. They are so soft-spoken and of course the language here makes you realize how beautiful our language is.”"

Banerjee walked to the protest venue, less than 100 metres from Raj Bhavan, after “meeting the Prime Minister of the country as the chief minister of the state” as she sought to pull off a fine balancing act between her roles as one of the most strident opponents of the new citizenship law and the CM of a state.
“I have expressed our continued opposition to CAA, NRC and urged the PM to do a rethink on the issue,” she said, adding, “But it is also my constitutional obligation to meet the country’s PM and President when they come to Kolkata. My colleague, minister Firhad Hakim, received the PM at the airport.”
I have told the PM about the Rs 28,000 crore that the Centre owes the state plus the Rs 7,000 crore we have spent on post-(Cyclone) Bulbul rehabilitation,"" she said.

Mamata Banerjee met PM Modi at Kolkata's Raj Bhawan on Saturday (ANI)
Banerjee, aware of the ground reality where a misstep may have unintended consequences, has been insisting on ""sarba dharma samanway"" and using traditional prayer symbols like conch shells and kansar-ghanta (gong-and-bell) in her anti-CAA-NRC campaign to deflect ""BJP's unfounded criticism"" of her ""vote-bank politics"". She has also referred to Swami Vivekananda's vision of India and reached out to Ganga Sagar pilgrims and temple authorities to preempt the BJP's ""misappropriation of religion"".
On Saturday, however, Banerjee also had to take guard against anti-CAA-NRC protesters' apprehensions of her going ""soft on the cause"". She went back to the Esplanade dharna site a second time in the evening and, after an intense face-off with non-Trinamool, anti-CAA-NRC protesters that lasted a few minutes, accused them of ""trying to fish in troubled waters"" and being ""BJP stooges"". ""I do not need any certificate about the sincerity of my cause from anyone,"" she said.
""I have led the Singur stir and made the government give back land to farmers. I have championed the fight against custodial deaths,"" she said, invoking ""student power"" and asking the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad to reach out to colleges and involve students in the anti-CAA-NRC stir. ""I came to politics from the student movement. Let students take the lead. We will take the back seat,"" Banerjee said.
Banerjee initially tried to reason with Jadavpur University students, who formed the bulk of the non-Trinamool protesters at Esplanade, that a showdown between anti-CAA-NRC forces would end up harming the larger cause. But, with the Trinamool ""CAA-CAA chhi-chhi (shame-shame)"" slogans being met with ""azaadi"" slogans, cops intervened to separate the Trinamool and non-Trinamool protesters' blocs. Banerjee finally called off the dharna around 9.40pm."

Most of the children belong to the lower strata of society, and the lack of a school would have meant the end of the road for them, as far as academics is concerned. But there’s now a ray of hope, as the Railway workshop in Mysuru, which is in the vicinity of the school, has found a solution to this problem. On Saturday, four decommissioned railway coaches at the workshop were thrown open as a makeshift school for these kids.
According to the school’s head mistress, HM Jayalakshmi, it was announced last year that the building would be demolished, and the new building would be up in a year. “Senior officials from the railway workshop came up with the idea of converting a few old coaches, which would have otherwise been sold for scrap metal, into classrooms,” she says.


Apart from fresh coats of paint, the bogies were also worked on to create the concept of Nali-Kali (learn while you play). From information about the solar system to alphabets, numbers and more, the railway department has gone all out to create an ideal environment for these children. When the ‘new school’ was thrown open for the kids, they excitedly scampered in to see their classrooms for the next year. “Our train school will begin functioning this week,” adds Jayalakshmi.

"Dhananjay Mahapatra | TNN | Updated: Jan 13, 2020, 00:13 IST",Dhananjay Mahapatra,India,"SC recognises internet users' right, also formalises their accountability","Internet services debuted in India on August 15, 1995, through Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited. It was a weird thing at the time as one had barely became familiar with the keyboard commands needed to operate a computer. Unfamiliar with the nature of the beast, offices had very few computers with internet connection and access to these were strictly monitored. The beast soon became beneficial and popular. In November 1998, the government allowed private players to provide internet services.
In two decades, internet became the busiest medium for dissemination of views, news and everything under the sun. The Supreme Court's nine-judge bench judgment in K S Puttaswamy case, which in August 2017 declared right to privacy to be part of right to life, paid handsome tributes to the internet and how it had become intrinsic to basic daily activities.
""Internet has become all pervasive as individuals spend more and more time online each day of their lives. Individuals connect with others and use the internet as means of communication. Internet is used to carry on business and to buy goods and services. Individuals browse the web in search of information, to send emails, use instant messaging services and to download movies,"" Justice D Y Chandrachud had said, while writing the main judgment in the privacy case.
""Online purchases have become an efficient substitute for the daily visit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has redefined relationships between bankers and customers. Online trading has created a new platform for the market in securities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online books have opened up a new universe for the bibliophile. Th old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered redundant by web portals which provide everything from restaurants to resthouses, airline tickets to art galleries, museum tickets to music shows. These are but a few of the reasons people access the internet each day of their lives,"" he had said.
While dwelling on the benefits of internet, the SC had noted concerns about private players monitoring an individual's choices and preferences exercised online daily to create meta data that became the proverbial gold mine of personal information, which business houses were ready to buy at a premium for commercial exploitation.
The SC acknowledged how difficult it was to get out of the web of internet. ""The impact of the digital age results in information on the internet being permanent. Humans forget, but the internet does not forget and does not let humans forget. Any endeavour to remove information from the internet does not result in its absolute obliteration. The footprints remain. It is, thus, said that in the digital world, preservation is the norm and forgetting a struggle,"" the bench said.
So, when individuals are so direly dependent on the internet, its suspension obviously has a disrupting effect. If something like internet has become fundamental to daily activities of individuals, should access to internet, like access to water, be treated as a fundamental right? The SC dealt with this issue in its judgment last week while testing the validity of the decision to shut down internet in J&K after August 5, when the state was stripped of its special status and divided into two Union Territories.
Writing the judgment for a three-judge bench, Justice N V Ramana distinguished between internet as a tool and freedom of expression through the medium of internet. The SC did not examine whether access to internet is a fundamental right as the issue was not raised by petitioners.
However, it held that ""freedom of speech and expression through the medium of internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a)"", under which the Constitution treats it as a fundamental right.
Taking a cue from the Puttaswamy case, the Justice Ramana-led bench rightly said since internet has become a important tool for trade and commerce, ""freedom of trade and commerce through the medium of internet is also constitutionally protected under Article 19(1)(g)"".
The verdict made netizens erupt in joy. Well, the SC's ruling that freedom of speech and trade and commerce through the medium of internet is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution automatically circumscribes these rights by the restrictions prescribed under Article 19(2).
Before this judgment, fastening accountability on those making comments on social media fell in the grey area, except probably in defamation cases as we saw many proceedings being initiated against individuals who heaped charges against some during the 'Me Too' movement.
With the SC formalising right to expression through internet as a fundamental right, it gave the government and authorities a handle to impose restrictions on use of internet or suspend internet in a particular area if they apprehended that it was needed to protect sovereignty, integrity and security of the country; not to harm friendly relations with foreign countries; protect public order, decency, morality and dignity of courts, stop defamation or incitement to an offence.
An important change was brought about by the SC by ruling that orders suspending or restricting internet services must be based on doctrine of proportionality and could be done only as a last resort after examining all other options. Moreover, all orders suspending internet services have to be notified and reviewed periodically by the authorities. Additionally, these orders were made subject to judicial scrutiny.
What emerges from the SC judgment is - those exercising free speech on social media would be held accountable for their words if these fell foul any of the restrictions enumerated in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. ""Your right ends where my nose (or belly) begins,"" is an age-old adage which social media users must keep in mind before chirping in writing."

"Sachin Parashar | TNN | Updated: Jan 13, 2020, 10:29 IST",Sachin Parashar,India,Article 370: India hopeful of winning support of Democrats on J&K,"NEW DELHI: While several Republicans in the US have publicly backed India's decision to revoke the special status of what was the state of J&K, many 'moderate' Democrat Congressmen too have reached out to the Indian government and have expressed understanding of India's position, according to senior Indian government sources. These Congressmen, said an official, are reluctant to speak out in public because of the 'ultra left-liberal flank' of the Democratic Party.
The six Congressmen to have spoken so far for India are all Republicans.
""The moderate elements within the Democratic Party, even if privately, have shown serious understanding of not just India’s position that the decision to amend Article 370 was meant to ensure economic opportunities and social justice but also the fact that Pakistan was exploiting the separatist sentiment in some areas of the Valley for perpetrating cross-border terrorism,"" claimed a senior official.
Many top Democrats, including presidential hopefuls like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have publicly expressed concern about the situation in J&K. While Sanders had described India’s actions as unacceptable, Warren had called for India to show respect for the rights of Kashmiri people.
After the Indian mission outreach led by ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shringla, official sources said, more Congressmen are said to be considering making statements in support of India’s position. Shringla returns to India this week to take charge as foreign secretary later this month.
Congressman Scott Perry last week became the 6th leader from the Republican Party to express support for India on the J&K issue. Perry is a 4th-term Congressman from Pennsylvania and is a member of important House Committees like Foreign Affairs and Transportation & Infrastructure.
“I stand with India in their aspiration to provide equal economic, social, and political opportunities to all citizens. As part of this pursuit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted last year to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of India to address the stagnant economy and high youth unemployment plaguing the region by providing economic opportunity and sound governance. The residents of Jammu and Kashmir have battled economic depression and forces of extremism and radicalization for too long. The regional stability now provided by government will give residents of Jammu and Kashmir a better way forward and hope for the future,"" Perry was quoted as having said. In March, 2019, Perry had introduced a resolution in the House to condemn the Pulwama terror attack.
Other Congressmen who have publicly backed India include Francis Rooney and Joe Wilson, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Speaking in the House, Wilson had said that India’s decision was meant to ""boost economic development, fight corruption and end gender, caste and religious discrimination"".
Congressmen Pete Olson, Paul Gosar and George Holding are the three others who have endorsed India’s position in public. The first Congressman to issue a statement on J&K, Holding had said that while Article 370 might have worked well for 'those with political connections,’ it denied economic opportunities for the people and that it also created a polarizing environment that was exploited politically.
""These are all very influential people in their own right. Holding is a member of House Ways and Means Committee which is the oldest committee of the US Congress. Gosar is the Chair of the House Committee on natural resources,"" said the official."
"Rajendra Sharma | TNN | Updated: Jan 13, 2020, 03:30 IST",Rajendra Sharma,India,Those who raise anti-national slogans will be sent to jail: Amit Shah,"BHOPAL: Those who raise slogans against India will be sent behind bars, BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Jabalpur on Sunday, his first since CAA came into force. A ‘sky-high’ Ram Mandir will be built in Ayodhya in just four months, he announced.
“Some students raised anti-India slogans, ‘Bharat tere tukde honge ek hazar, Inshallah Inshallah’ at JNU. Shouldn’t they be put in jail? Those who would raise anti-national slogans will be sent behind bars,” said Shah at the CAA outreach rally.
The BJP chief challenged Congress to stop construction of Ram temple. “Should Ram temple be constructed or not? Congress leader and advocate Kapil Sibal said it should not be built. Sibal bhai, stop it if you can. A sky-high Ram temple is going to come up within the next four months.”
Shah challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee to point out a single provision in CAA that can take away any Indian’s citizenship.
“Congress and opposition parties are misleading the nation on CAA and instigating minorities,” he alleged, adding: “After Independence, Congress divided the country on the basis of religion. Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis and Jains, who lived in both East and West Pakistan wanted to return, but they stayed because of the bloodshed. The leaders of our country had assured them that they will be welcomed here and given the citizenship whenever they want.”
Justifying CAA, Shah said, “After Partition, there were 30% Hindus in both East and West Pakistan. Today, there are just 3% Hindus in Pakistan and 7% Hindus in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). I want to ask the blind and deaf Congress leaders, where have the Hindus, Sikh, Sindhi brothers gone? Where have Machhua (fishermen) of Bangladesh vanished?”
“Mahatma Gandhi had said, they were citizens of India and would be welcomed here when they want to return. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had also promised to give them Indian citizenship, but Congress is running away from the promise. We will do everything for them. Those who were being tormented will be rehabilitated here. Congress should open its ears and listen. Do whatever you can. We will give citizenship to all of them,” Shah emphasised.
The home minister also raised the issue of human rights violations in Pakistan and said, “Atrocities are being committed in Pakistan on minorities. Gurudwara Nanakana Sahib was attacked and the daughter of the Granthi kidnapped. What is happening there? Why is Congress not raising this matter?”
Shah also quoted the election manifesto of Rajasthan Congress, which promises to provide citizenship to Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan. “Now, Congress is refusing. The party is misleading the public. I would like to assure that there is no provision of taking back citizenship of any Indian citizen,” he said.
Accusing Congress of propagating lies, Shah said: “We will tell the public how Mamata Banerjee, Kejriwal and Rahul Baba are spreading false information. We will contact more than 3 crore people under the awareness drive. BJP has committed to finish some tasks since 1950. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has completed those tasks.”
Congress opposes every move taken by the BJP-led NDA government, he said. “Congress is opposing every decision, from Article 370, 35A, to Ram temple, triple talaq, surgical strike, air strike, and now citizenship law. For vote bank politics, Congress is singing the tune of Pakistan and Imran on every issue. I urge Congress to return from the wrong path. It should understand the feelings of the public else, you (Congress) will be completely wiped out,” said Shah.
The BJP president also hit out at Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath for refusing to implement CAA. “Nath should not talk loud. Instead, he should focus on MP. The state has already been handed over to liquor and sand mafia. We are searching for gaushalas that Congress had promised in MP but couldn’t see a single one. Farmers who have been cheated in the name of loan waiver are demanding bonus on wheat. If you have the strength, then come on the (election) ground. Public makes mistake once, not every time. We will trounce you by two-thirds majority,” claimed Shah.
The BJP chief lauded former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and said people still remember the government he led in MP. MP BJP chief Rakesh Singh, leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava and Union minister Faggan Singh Kulaste were also at the rally."

"Tanvi PS | TNN | Jan 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,City,Bengalureans head out on an ant trail,"On a crisp weekend morning at Lalbagh recently, eager parents and children had gathered together for an ‘ant walk’. Guided by Sunil Kumar M – a senior science adviser at a foreign embassy, who has spent nearly 25 years observing ants – the event saw participants, armed with magnifying glasses, taking a stroll in the park to get a closer view of the lifestyle of this ‘eusocial’ insect.
Different types of ants and the activities they carry out

As the participants start observing the acrobat ants, Sunil explains that in an ant colony, specific roles are allocated to each ant. The queen ant is at the apex of the social hierarchy
Queen ant:
Throughout her life, the queen primarily has only one purpose – to lay eggs and expand the colony. In most cases, the queen ant picks her successor. The untimely death of a queen may also signify the death of the colony. To ensure her protection, she is always hidden deep inside the ant colony.
Infertile male and female ants:
These ants usually act as workers, foragers, nurses and care-givers for offspring. Their duties include finding food and cleaning the nest.
Fertile male and female ants:
The fertile male ants are thrown out of the colony, after which they need to find a virgin queen ant to mate with. Similarly, the fertile female ants are also thrown out. They can start their own colony once they find a suitable mate. Sometimes, these ants also challenge the authority of an existing female ant, in order to become the next queen.

Fun fact:
Ever noticed an ant with wings? These are often the fertile male or female ants that are given wings, so that they can find a new mate and start a new colony.

Ants reprimand bad behaviour

If a worker ant tries to go rogue, fellow worker ants are known to bite that ant and bring it back into line. This happens because ants believe in working towards the greater good for the colony.

Conquests and colony expansion

Ants’ most common enemies are termites – they often fight for survival in similar habitats. Ants are also known to wage war on other ant colonies, in order to capture more worker ants for their own colony. The conquerors, thus, add more workers to their own colonies, branding them with their trademark smell.

Farming and water harvesting

Some ants take up farming and grow fungus. They also milk a few insects and drink their nectar. Some others again use feathers for their nests in a way that they catch the morning dew and store it for later use.

The travel patterns that ants follow

After spotting a solitary ant, a participant of the walking group asked, “Don’t ants walk in lines?” Responding to that, Sunil said that the trail network is not a general characteristic. According to him, some ant colonies are large in number, so foragers set out together and bring food home. They leave the trails on their path with pheromones, as if to announce: “Look, I found food here.” However, some colonies have fewer ants and, in such a situation, solitary ants set out to find food.
He also shared a research that he and his team had undertaken, in which they marked large forager ants that stepped out to get food in specific colours and studied their routines. “Ants are very disciplined, and they stick to the paths assigned to them. Among the ones we had marked, we saw that each ant stuck to a particular route. One day, however, we removed one of these colour-marked ants. And we were stunned to find that the very next day, a non-marked ant stepped out looking for food in the same path of the ant that we had removed, indicating there was some knowledge transfer taking place in the nest,” he explains.
Do ants bite or sting?

On their way, the participants spot a red weaver ant on a tree. “Careful. They sting when alarmed,” warned Sunil, adding, “Often when ants bite or sting, they risk injuring themselves. There are some ants that have evolved in a way that they can bite into your skin first, to cause a cut, and then spray chemical water inside the wound.”

Some of the common ants found in Bengaluru

Fire ant (solenopsis geminate): Infamous for their biting habit, these ants can easily adapt to any surroundings.
Black crazy ant (paratrechina longicornis): A black crazy ant is known for her habit of cleaning her own legs
Odour ants (tapinoma melanocephalum): These house ants apparently lap up sugar.
Acrobat ant (crematogaster: An acrobat ant lifts her gaster to release alarm pheromones
Weaver ant (oecophylla smaragdina): These ants are said to coax their offspring to release silk that they use to stick leaves as they build their nest.
Did you know?

Some ants are blind. These insects can function perfectly well without eyes. They can go about their daily tasks using only their sense of touch and smell."

"Julie Mariappan | TNN | Jan 14, 2020, 00:02 IST",Julie Mariappan,India,"By 2030, 57% of global power demand should be met by renewables: IRENA","ABU DHABI: Renewable energy should supply 57% of global power demand by the end of the decade, up from 26% now, according to the intergovernmental International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
A booklet, ‘10 years:Progress toAction’, published on the sidelines of 10th annual Assembly of IRENA in Abu Dhabi, has charted the recent global advances and outlined the measures required to scale up renewables. Annual investment needs to double from around $329 billion in 2018 to$737 billion to deploy renewable energy at the speed required. Much of it could be met by redirecting planned fossil fuel investments. IRENA director-general Francesco La Camera said, “We must urgently address the need for stronger enabling policies and a significant increase in investment over the next ten years. Renewables hold the key to sustainable development and should be central to energy and economic planning all over the world.”
Additional investments bring significant savings by minimising losses caused by climate change because of inaction. Savings could amount to between $1.6 trillion and $307 trillion annually by 2030, IRENA said.
Strengthening the case for renewable energy,IRENA pointedtofalling technologycosts. Solar PV costs fell by 87% over the last ten years, and onshore wind turbine prices by 46%.
IRENA data shows that 60% of new electricity access can be met by renewables in the next decade through stand-alone and mini-grid systems. The global energy transformation by 2030 could also lead to generation of 30 million jobs.
Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development on Sunday approved a $105-million loan for renewableenergy projectsin eight developing countries—Antigua, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cuba,theMaldives, Nepal, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

"Vinay Lokesh | TNN | Jan 15, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,City,Fire lines created to prevent forest fire in Bandipur,"Forest fires are a concern for people across the world. Even as Australia continues to battle the bush fires that have been ravaging the continent, back home, officials have been working tirelessly ensure that our forests do not fall prey to a blaze. A year ago, the Bandipur Tiger Reserve lost flora and fauna in over 10,000 acres owing to a massive forest fire, and officials are now trying to prevent a repeat by creating a 2,550 kilometre fire line.
Towards this, the forest department is undertaking clearing of vegetation and controlled burning of the same to create bald patches of land across the boundary line of the forest to prevent the wild spreading of a fire. Speaking to us, director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, T Balachandra, says, “We are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that last year's tragedy is not repeated. We have created 2,550 kilometres of fire lines in all 13 ranges of the Reserve. We are hoping to complete all work in creating fire lines to be completed in a week's time. We have deployed temporary watchers in all ranges to prevent any illegal acts by miscreants that could spark a fire. We are also interacting with the villagers living on the fringes of the forest to create awareness about their role in protecting forests from fires.”
A wildlife enthusiast says, “Over the last two years, the ecology in Bandipur has been severely affected by forest fires. I hope the forest department has learnt its lessons from the previous mass destruction. Right now, everything is dry in Bandipur, so chances of it catching fire are high. But if we do get a few spells of rain in February or March, that could be averted. The forest department needs to be well-equipped to prevent forest fires.”"

But the nature of the city has also been such that people had to hitherto take to the streets only for issues that were more civic and lifestyle related, like the diminishing green cover, nightlife issues or new infrastructure harming the cityscape.
In a curious twist, though, in the last one month or so, Bengalureans across age groups, religion, gender and social status have stood up to voice their stance over ongoing political discourses in the nation. Regardless of their point of view, they found protests to join. This begets the question, has Bengaluru suddenly become more politically aware?
‘Bengaluru raises its voice’
Actress and politician Malavika Avinash observes, “Bengaluru has always been a vibrant city, even though it has not been as expressive as Mumbai or Delhi. This is because it is a melting pot of cultures. Its cosmopolitan nature has grown over the past few decades, which is why we see a far more expressive society now. This is very good, as it is important that people express their opinions in a thriving democracy. It doesn’t matter which side they take. Bengaluru seems to be leading South India when it comes to this kind of democratic expression. This has always been seen in Delhi and Mumbai. I am glad that South India has a voice and it has risen from Bengaluru.” Agreeing with her, activist Srinivas Alavilli adds, “Bengaluru is the best example of tolerance, inclusivity and diversity. All of these are ideals upheld by our constitution. There is no one leader, this is a decentralised leader-less movement, which is amazing as people are finding it important to raise their voice and debate, irrespective of the point of view. This is how a healthy democracy should function.”
Youngsters, women lead the way
Actor and activist Chetan points out that this is not just limited to Bengaluru. “If we look at the world today, be it Puerto Rico, Chile or even Hong Kong, there are massive protests that are majorly led by youth, also with the leadership of women. The fact that women, youngsters and students are coming out and voicing their opinions in Bengaluru is a very positive trend. Vandalism is also a form of protest, but the fact that people have discarded that option and chosen a progressive and more peaceful debate is a positive sign, regardless of the ideological basis,” he opines.
Filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh, too, adds that the youth being a part of this is commendable. “Freedom fighter HS Doreswamy recently said that this is only the third time that he is seeing something like this. The first time he saw students partake in a political debate and join protests was during the freedom struggle. The second was during the Emergency. This is the third time that he has seen so many students become aware. Students are the future. If they vote for the political leaders, it is only right that they also should discuss and debate about them. I was at a protest in Town Hall recently and there were many students,” she says.
Srinivas Alavilli goes a step further and says that this could be akin to the emotions seen in the film Rang De Basanti. “The kind of art they are producing, the slogans they are raising and the messages they convey, I see it almost like a Rang De Basanti happening in Bengaluru. We all underestimate the younger generation citing their lack of awareness or apathetic nature. This past one month has made me believe in our future generation. Social media has played a binding force,” he adds."

"Sandra Marina Fernandes | TNN | Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,City,A 20-minute art face-off between Bengaluru artists,"Bengaluru witnessed a quirky riot of colours over the weekend — one that involved the easel, music and a lot of fun. Some 12 artists competed against each other to bag the top slot at the maiden edition of Art Battle Bengaluru. The live painting global tournament saw several art lovers come together to encourage and support the cause of art.
Speaking about the first edition of the event in namma ooru, Pooja Shirali, an organiser, said, “We got to know about this global tournament from a friend, who had participated in the Seattle chapter of it. We found out that this is the world’s largest live art tournament, which takes place in more than 60 cities. But, apparently, it had never happened in India before, which is why we wanted to do this here.”
There were two rounds in the competition, two winners from which were then pitted against each other in the final round. As the artists continued painting, the audiences moved around them in a circle, viewing each artist in action. The winners were chosen by the audience. “The artists weren’t given any theme to follow. They could paint whatever they wanted to, within a time frame of 20 minutes. We did have applicants from other cities as well, but for the first edition, we decided to have only local artists,” says Kaavya Sampath, another organiser.
Nanvi Singh Jhala — a student of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology — was the youngest participant in the art event. Sharing her experience, Nanvi said, “It was both crazy and intense to compete live in front of an audience, with music playing in the background. But I enjoyed the vibe of it. We should have more of such events in the city, as they open the door to many opportunities.”
Chetan S Murthy, a professional artist from Bengaluru, was declared the winner, after he bagged maximum audience votes. He will now compete on the national level. The winner at the national level will then compete at the international tournament, which is scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in October this year."

"Reema Gowalla | TNN | Updated: Jan 24, 2020, 14:13 IST",Reema Gowalla,City,Putting a play together through video calls felt like a miracle: Jeff Baron,"Scheduling a team meeting across different time zones or firing an employee sitting at a remote location over a video call is something technology allows you to do today. Boon or bane? That debate can go on. But bringing out an entire drama production — from the initial talks to the final rehearsals — via a telecommunications app looks like a big plunge for the theatre world. And that’s the curious story behind the Bengaluru premiere of American author-playwright-director Jeff Baron’s globally popular play,
Visiting Mr. Green
— a comedy-drama that sifts through generations, religion, culture and sexuality. Written more than two decades ago, this award-winning piece has had over 500 productions in nearly 25 languages. India is the 50th nation to stage the play. The play will be staged at Ranga Shankara on February 1 (3.30 pm and 7.30 pm). In a telephonic conversation from New York, Jeff spoke to us about the Indian adaptation that features veteran theatre personality, MK Raina (as Mr Green), and actor Aakash Prabhakar (as Ross Gardiner), what he finds interesting about the Indian audience and more. Excerpts:

‘Speaking through computer screens seemed more intimate than meeting in person’

Ambitious as it may sound, the fact that I started working with Raina and Aakash through video calls, sitting in my New York City apartment, a few months before we met in person, was a huge leap of faith for all of us. Yes, technology has made the world a smaller place in many ways, but conducting rehearsals online was a unique experience. I eventually started working with music composer Prashanth Srinivas, set designer Vivek Jadhav, lighting designer Vikrant Thakar, stage manager Jaymin Thakkar, and assistant director Mallika Shah, as well. It felt like working with old friends and colleagues; a true meeting of the minds. I think virtual communication is the way forward, as it can open the door to more transcultural collaborations in theatre.

What makes Visiting Mr. Green a relevant watch in India today

Visiting Mr. Green
, which runs for 1 hour and 35 minutes, is a cross-generational play that has resonated with people from different cultures. It is known to promote a certain sense of tolerance across national and societal borders. The narrative is basically a conversation between an 86-year-old widower and a 29-year-old corporate executive, who is ordered by the court to routinely visit the former, after the latter almost ran over him in a case of reckless driving. The play investigates our deep-seated religious differences, while also addressing questions of sexuality. As the tone of the script goes from comic to serious and back, the narrative keeps the focus on how people from different generations look at things differently. The play is partly autobiographical; it’s about real experiences. Thus, many find it quite relatable too. Plans are afoot to come up with a Hindi translation for the play, which will enable us to take the production to more towns and cities across the country. The play was earlier staged in Greece, Germany, Mexico, Israel, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Uruguay, among other nations.

‘There is an intellectual rigour in Indian theatre’

There is some really fine craftsmanship that I have noticed among playwrights and actors in India. There is an intellectual rigour which, I think, is exclusive to this country. I am very keen on working with more people from the theatre circuit in India. What also amazed me was that people from various age groups enjoy theatre here, and they respond to this art form so well. In the US and Europe, the scene is quite different. You’ll mostly see silver hair in the audience."

"Hansy Sanctis | TNN | Jan 23, 2020, 00:00 IST",Hansy Sanctis,City,Lalbagh pays floral homage to Swami Vivekananda,"More than 10,000 visitors thronged Lalbagh Botanical Garden on the opening day of this year’s flower show. The 2020 edition of this popular city event is dedicated to Swami Vivekananda. Apart from the floral installations, the event is also conducting horticultural competitions. Scheduled to go on till January 26, the flower show saw over 36,000 visitors during the first weekend.
Commenting on the 211th chapter of the flower show, MR Chandrashekhar — Secretary of the Mysore Horticultural Society and Deputy Director of Horticulture, Lalbagh Botanical Garden — says, “It took more than two months to put up the entire floral arrangement. Around 120 people worked on a tight schedule to ensure that we met the deadline. This year, we have tried different installations, with the most popular one so far being the vertical garden that uses fences or trellis to
support the plants.”
Docus, books and flowers mark SWAMI Vivekananda’s legacy
This year’s show is a tribute to Swami Vivekananda on his 157th birth anniversary. From Belur Math to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, the Glasshouse is filled with floral replicas of these places, along with his statues. Another highlight was a depiction of him delivering his famous Chicago speech. The flower arrangements featured more than four lakh flowers of different colours, while the statues were carved out of bronze and sandstone. A documentary on Vivekananda is being screened at the venue, while visitors were also spotted browsing through books on him. The glasshouse also had a display of over 106 boards, listing different inspiring quotes by him.
Complete ban on plastic
There is a complete ban on the use of plastic at Lalbagh during the flower show, with over 60 workers and 40 volunteers from different NGOs making sure that visitors do not litter the place. According to organisers, a total of 240 bins and signs, reading ‘do not litter’ and ‘do not use plastic’, have been put up. Meanwhile, earthenware is turning out to be a popular choice among shoppers at the exhibition this year.
Popular flower choices
On display are around 92 varieties of flowers. Out of these, 37 are imported from countries like South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Holland and Thailand. Some of the popular choices are:
1. Gloxinia
2. Dwarf Ixora
3. Medinilla
4. Cyclamen
5. Petunia
6. Vinca
7. Cymbidium Orchid
Ornamental horticulture competitions
The event is hosting many ornamental horticulture competitions, like Janur Dry Flower Arrangement, Dutch Flower Arrangement, Vegetable Art and Sculpture, Thai Art.
The iconic flower show is in its 211th edition
This iconic flower show, which generally takes place twice a year, began in the year 1912. It was started by Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel, the then manager of the botanical garden. Lalbagh is also said to hold an international record for conducting the most number of flower shows in a year. The Glasshouse, which is the primary attraction during these shows, was built in 1889."

is about the evening of life. Known for its nostalgic charm, the play, based on a novella by the same name, sees the doyen among actors take the stage as a narrator. Amid lights and music, he embarks on a journey with the audience, investigating the mundane voices that riddle the life of a lonely woman, named Amma Bi, in her deserted Lucknow

. “It’ll be an evening of theatre in Bengaluru,” says the veteran artiste, who is set to present a dramatised reading of
Dopehri
in the city, a tale he had penned nearly 30 years ago. “It’s an entertaining piece that brings alive literature on stage,” he adds. Presented by Flo Bangalore, the show will be held at Chowdiah Memorial Hall on February 6.
Pankaj finds Bengaluru to be a culturally-aware city. “Every time I am in town, either performing a play on stage or speaking at a literature festival, I have noticed that people here are very well-educated and informed. Audiences respond to each nuance of a performance — be it storyline, structure or dialogues — which is kind of encouraging for the artiste,” he says. When he had brought his play,
Saher
, to Bengaluru a couple of years ago, several local actors were made part of its ensemble cast. “We usually don’t get the time to watch local plays when we are travelling with a production. But this gave us the opportunity to interact with local actors. And it was a good experience,” he explains.
When asked about his perspective on India’s current socio-political situation, Pankaj says, “People are already speaking up about what’s happening in the country right now. I don’t think there is anything new to add. But all I want to say is that every human being is the same, and everyone should be treated with equal respect.”
Amid all the travelling, film shoots, stage performances and writing, the veteran actor also takes time out to be with his grandchildren, Misha and Zain. He says, “I usually meet them on Sundays. They are delightful kids. I don’t get to spend as much time with them as I would want to because of my work schedule. But, like any other grandfather, I am indulgent when I am with them. It’s amazing to see the two growing up together.”
Fresh from the success of his ode to Charlie Chaplin,

, Pankaj says he might be writing more short stories in the near future, some of which might turn into stage adaptations too."

"Deepa Soman | TNN | Jan 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Deepa Soman,City,"Major Anirudh Nair: When I march today on Rajpath, it would be a childhood dream coming true","Anirudh Nair’s grandfather was an army man and during his childhood, watching the Republic Day parade on TV, with family, was a tradition. But, little did the youngster, who is now 26, know that he too would march on Rajpath one day – that too leading a contingent.
Major Anirudh, who hails from Palakkad, will lead the Grenadiers’ contingent at the Republic Day parade today in Delhi and for him, it will also be a memorable achievement, earned after months of preparation and hard work. “Despite the chilly climate in Delhi, we have been going at 2 am to Rajpath, so that we put our best foot forward for a great parade on January 26,” says the man, who was chosen the contingent leader post a process that went on from June to November 2019. “It was a proud, joyous moment. I called my parents first, and then called my school in Vadodara, saying that I would be representing them on Rajpath! For someone who used to watch the march on TV with parents during childhood, it is a dream coming true,” he says.
His contingent is often the cynosure of all eyes at any parade they are in, thanks to their regal looks complete with the handlebar moustache and colourful safa (turban). They are taking part in the parade this year after four years. Anirudh says, “Every regiment takes part in the parade once in four or five years. The last time we took part, we walked home winning the Best Marching Contingent Award, and the team could be part of Victoria’s parade in Russia as well. We hope to do well this time too.”
Most of his crew members are deployed in border areas. “We don’t regularly do drills either. Bringing the 144 people for the parade together, ensuring that each of them stay fit in the tough weather of Delhi, and getting them all to march to the rhythm were all challenges,” says Anirudh, who has been in the army for the past four and half years, after finishing studies from National Defence Academy and Indian Military Academy.
A man who has spent most of his years outside of Kerala, how well does he connect with the State? “I’m quite a Malayali at heart,” says Anirudh, whose mom was apparently quite strict about him speaking his mother tongue at home. “She also tried to get me to read and write Malayalam well, albeit unsuccessfully. But, we used to come to Kerala at least 10 times a year during my childhood. My dad was in the railways and getting passes weren’t an issue for us. All our relatives are also in Kerala. Even now, I come as much as I can. A few months ago, my engagement was also in Kerala,” says Anirudh who recently got married to Ankita Jamwal, who works in Indian Space Research Organisation."
