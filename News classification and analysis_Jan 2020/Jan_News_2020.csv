"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Shivin Narang injures his hand on the set of his show,"Shivin Narang, who had suffered an injury a few weeks ago, when he was shooting a scene with his co-actor Jennifer Winget, has again met with an accident on the sets of 'Beyhadh 2'.

The actor, who had to run during a shot, fell, injuring his hand. Though he ignored it initially as something minor, by evening, his left hand had swollen and he had to be admitted to a hospital in Andheri. Shivin was later diagnosed with a hairline fracture.


The actor told us, “The scene involved my on-screen younger brother and me chasing each other in the bedroom. That’s when I fell on my hand. Since it’s a fracture, I have had to cancel my New Year plans with family; I had planned a trip to Mahabaleshwar. I will also not be able to shoot for a couple of days. I am thankful to God that I was discharged and was able to spend time with my parents. During my earlier two shows, too, I had suffered many injuries. This is a part and parcel of our job. Hopefully, 2020 will be a good year without any injuries.”"
"Updated: Jun 29, 2020, 00:35 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,Allergy cases on the rise in Bengaluru,"Have you been suffering from cough, throat congestion, nasal discharge or itchy nose? If you’ve been complaining of any of these symptoms, chances are that you’ve fallen prey to allergens around you. Bengaluru has been witnessing a rise in allergy cases and the problem has affected many residents in the city. BT talks to experts to find out the reasons for the spike in such cases and how to keep them at bay...

Most patients suffer from nasal allergies
Apart from the city’s erratic weather, experts point to the depleting air quality — indoor and outdoor — as the reason for the spike in such cases, especially around this time of the year. On average, city clinics and hospitals record approximately 20 allergic rhinitis, allergic rashes and eczema cases every day. Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, a city-based lung specialist, says, “At least 50% of my outpatient cases comprise nasal allergies and most of the patients come when their condition is worse. This is a common problem, especially during winter.”


Dust mites and pollen trigger allergies
“Seasonal allergies mostly occur because of dust mites, animal dander (such as fur or dead skin cells of animals) and cockroach droppings, etc. Mold, too, causes seasonal allergies. Symptoms include sneezing, wheezing and itching in the eyes. In Bengaluru, pollen from flowering trees add to the problem. It is suggested to avoid exposure to known triggers. One can use humidifiers to minimise allergies,” advises Dr S Manohar, an Internal Medicine specialist at a city hospital. Dr Gayathri Pandit, Consultant ENT surgeon and Allergy Specialist, explains, “House dust mites are often called asthamogenic allergen. It is a major cause of combined upper and lower respiratory allergy. It is also a common first allergen sensitivity to be seen in children. In the skin-prick allergy test that we conduct, nearly 75% to 80% comprise house dust mite allergy. It’s also the main respiratory allergen, contributing to nearly 75% of sensitivity. At least, 20% allergies are caused by pollens — Parthenium, Amaranthus Spinosus, Prosopis Juliflora, Ricinus Communis and castor oil plant. These may lead to respiratory illness.”

Poor air quality aggravates allergies
The rising pollution levels in Bengaluru also aggravate the problem. “Apart from pollen, the drop in air quality, because of construction, dust, fume and emissions from vehicles, also trigger allergies. With clouds trapping all the allergens and pollutants, the condition can worsen for many people. Poor air quality can make asthma and allergies worse,” explains Dr Vivek."

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",KAVYA CHRISTOPHER,Entertainment,"I respect my competitors, because they bring out the best in me: Yash","Every once in a while, there comes a star. The decade gone by has done the needful and given the film industry one. Today, Yash is not just a star in the Kannada film industry, but is one who is recognised beyond language and geographical boundaries. It is, incidentally, this very vision that this youngster set out with 10 years ago. For this artiste, who makes no bones about calling himself a businessman at the core, changing mindsets — of his audience, the people he works with and most importantly, his own, have been the most challenging aspect of his journey. “There are only a few things such as one’s health, accidents etc., that is beyond one’s control. For everything else, hard work and perseverance can make anything possible,” he states. Inspiring? Well, that is just the beginning. At the onset of a new decade today, here’s decoding the man who has become the kind of star that many often dream about…
How has your journey over this last decade been, how has it shaped the person you are today?
The decade has been wonderful. The first best thing that happened to me over the last decade was the fact that I met Radhika (Pandit), my wife. Our relationship started around 2011, I think I was shooting for my film Lucky at that time. So, on the personal front (with regards to love, marriage, and children), it has been wonderful. On the professional front, the commercial success that my films Kirataka and Lucky achieved sort of set the path ahead during the initial years of the decade. I have always believed that whatever you do will become a stepping stone in your career — whether it was good or bad. I do believe everything happens for the good. Every incident or action has a lot of points that help you chalk out your way forward. Even if there is something that you see as a bad episode, it does give you an opportunity to learn from it. One must always take everything in a very positive way. When I look back, I have had a positive mindset and a bit of aggression. I didn’t think of it in the form of a decade as such, but every year I focused on being better and bigger. I knew there was a lot within me, to explore, to understand.

I do believe everything happens for the good. I believe that the whole world is on this journey with you and is looking at you. When you want to achieve something, you have to first convince yourself that it is possible, and you need to be crazy about it. You have to believe that it is going to happen, and it will happen eventually.
What role does god or destiny play in how a person’s life turns out?
God has a plan, that is there. But you don’t change your field when you are looking for that path or destiny. One decade is a very long time for one to be able to create something out of your life in your profession. If you spend 10 years working passionately, in any profession, eventually you will end up being something. To be able to stay on and survive there itself is a big thing.
To sustain, in spite of all the difficulties and problems that come with the job and still stick on — not doing the same old thing, but keep on improving and bettering yourself while at it — eventually, you will end up being something you would be proud of. Personally speaking, I can say that yes, today — whatever I am today is because of the work that I have put in over the last decade.

The past year has been crucial in terms of change for you to a large extent, thanks to KGF. In fact, it has changed the positioning of Kannada cinema in the world of cinema. Tell us about this journey.
Kannada films have always been there. But there was an issue with the mind set of our people about our industry. I used to feel really bad, especially when you see other industry being respected in the state. When it comes to IT, they say Bengaluru is the IT city. When it is about fashion, they say Bengaluru is one of the best in the field. We excel in English and Kannada theatre, we win so many awards for literature. Kannadigas were proud about so many of these things, except Kannada films. They would say, Kannada is a small industry, it has its limitations. At that point, I felt, I am here and people have given me the chance or an opportunity to make a difference. And when I have that kind of power where I can bring in a change, if I don’t do anything about it, or if I don’t even try, I will be a failure.
As far as KGF is concerned, I have always brought in this comparison. Look at our soldiers, they go to war. Irrespective of whether he wins or he dies, a soldier will always be respected. So, like that, I always felt, we are soldiers. We had to do this to fight for our respect. In this process, I figured that perception and mindsets were the main issue. To tackle that, I started talking positive. I started building an atmosphere around me where I told everybody that it is changing. When you start thinking about good things, or when you start imagining good things, when you say that something good is going to happen, you are excited about something, you will then start focusing only on those good things and you will somehow get there. I started putting that thought into the minds of people around me. Soon, my producers started thinking, ‘yes, we can change.’ If one person believes in something, and others around this person see that there is a positive change and that it is working, then will follow you. There was a point when after I had said something positive, a day or two later, someone else would come to me and tell me the same thing. That’s how I knew it was working. So, first you have to convince yourself and then you need to bring in change. There is the whole idea of law of attraction — yes, it does work. In my life, it has happened. During this process, I tried stretching the market, brought in new quality, and eventually brought in competition. If there is no competition, the market is not good. Why do we compete? We compete because there is potential. I wanted this kind of competition, because where there is competition, the quality goes high. When the quality goes up, people start noticing.
There was a time when people, including friends of mine, were not willing to say ‘we watch Kannada films’. It was not cool to say so. It was important to address that mindset. If my own friends are telling me that they do not watch Kannada films, but were keen on watching other regional films, we had to relook at what was lacking. From the technicalities involved, to the budgets for a film, or even the styling, there are a lot of elements involved. We started identifying and recognising talents. I worked with the younger crop in various departments. I did not work with seniors in the field, because what happens is they already have their way around their work that has brought them success. They would not want to change that equation that has been working for them. With youngsters, there is a sense of open-mindedness where was keen on exploring. I also had Jayanna as a producer who believed in me. He produced five of my films back-to-back. Each time, the budget went higher than the previous one. We were constantly exploring and experimenting with new things.
In the market too, in the borders of the south states, they were not playing Kannada films. That changed too, coincidentally though. It was the time when there was a brief ban on Telugu film screenings during the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana issue. At that time, screens in these areas started approaching us for our films. As luck would have it, two or three films of mine were out around that time. I gave them Googly and Raja Huli on the condition that if the ban is off soon, they cannot remove my film if there is a demand for it. These were well-maintained theatres that usually only played films of other languages. And our films being screened there worked for us. Once they got familiar with our work, my next film also was received in a big way in that area. That is how I stretched my market. There was extra revenue coming in from all these areas, we directed that towards our next films to raise the bar yet again in terms of bringing in quality. All of this was the process where we started building and restructuring the way we work on our films while addressing all the issues that were identified. We started working with talent, some of our writers turned directors — be it Santosh Anandram or Manju Mandavya. Honestly, I cannot claim to be the only person who brought about a change here, but these are some of the issues that I personally noticed and started addressing.

Do you see a change in the way people from other states see you today?
I had been to a couple of award ceremonies before where I had noticed a sort of discrimination towards Kannada films and actors here. I believe that there is nothing called big industry or small industry. People who work there make it big or small. Karnataka is rich in everything, we have the resources, we have our people who love our culture. I felt that attitude towards us was not right. If you start competing with your neighbouring states, you will end up making films that are just about up to that standard. Our aim should be to compete with world cinema. Luckily, my director Prashant Neel had the vision and talent to see it through, my producer Vijay Kiran, has the kind of passion and resource to facilitate the same. Incidentally, KGF was not made for pan India. It was a film for Karnataka. While filming it, I realised it had the potential to be a pan-India film. Prashant was sceptical. To be honest, he is not happy with what he has done with KGF Chapter 1. What he is doing in KGF 2, you will see a pan-India film.
Today, I am happy with the way people talk about our industry. I think I have helped push towards that change at least partially. It was about changing mindset. For instance, you see people jumping signals. That happens, not because there is a lack of policing, but because people believe they can get away with it. We need to break that mindset. Today, when it comes to Kannada cinema, people are stretching their limits, aiming to produce quality work. The audience is expanding too, and people who do not even know the language here now ask about Kannada films they can check out.

Kannada films have had to find space for themselves amidst competition from other language films being released here in Karnataka. Has Pan-India releases of films from here changed the way we look at competition?
There was a point when we would think so much about when we could release our films. There was always an attempt to release films when no other big releases from other industries were posing a threat to our market. If you go back and check history, I have released my films on the same day as some of the bigger and promising Bollywood films. I was confident about my product, I tried. At the end the day, if both the films are good, people with watch both. If our film is good, it will never be deprived. People will come and watch it and they did. Now, nobody is worried about which other language film is releasing in Karnataka. Now, the other industries have to think about when they release their films in our state. That itself is a change in the mindset. Instead, we are looking at pan India releases for so many of our films today. Just like how our people have supported other language films here before, their people are now supporting our films in their states. It is no more regional, it is global.

How about competition from within the Kannada film industry?
I respect my competitors because they bring out the best in me. When they say that they are the best, a person like me will say — okay, hold on, you don’t know what’s in store, what’s coming. I respect them they do a good job and I enjoy it when they are successful. I enjoy their success. But I also say, watch out. If I start feeling that they should fail, then I will fail. Imagine there is a race, where everybody falls and you win. Can you call yourself a winner? No. I want everyone to run fast. But I want to win that race. Competition is always good, and it is there in our industry now. There are many people and I want many more to come. For our industry to grow and become bigger, we need more heroes. We need more stars, more films that assure you of definite guarantee of success. People say you should be doing at least two movies a year. If a subject demands a shorter period to work on, I will look at it. But as of now, I do not see myself doing that.

A success of one film gives rise to hope, but also gives rise to assumptions about success, attempts to recreate the success. The industry has so many films in a year that release and disappear without a trace. Are people being misled into drowning their investments?
People do get influenced by the success of one film, and they go overboard, and they may end up losing money. But today, there are enough platforms where a bit of strategy and planning will ensure your investment on a movie is safe. The truth is that in film industries worldwide, only a few films make money, not all films make that mark. Still, you cannot discourage people from making that film. So, many people, like me, run away from home to be an actor. Very few survive. But that does not mean you can question or discourage another aspiring actor from pursuing his dreams. As for quality of a film, it is debatable topic. My mother might think I am the most handsome guy on earth. Someone else’s mother may think her son is the most handsome one around. A film is one’s baby. You do get carried away, but that’s how the trade is. What works today may not work tomorrow. One should be updated. If I am not updated, I shouldn’t be here. The people who want to come into this industry should do proper research. Nowadays, every Friday every film says they broke all records. That is bullshit. They should project the right figures. Today, things are becoming more transparent, because of GST etc. People are forced to present the correct picture. Because for a layman, or for a newcomer, or a new producer — claims of broken records are misleading and they will not be able to make informed decisions as far as their projects are concerned. I want them to be more careful.

How is the new decade looking for you?
I am a very optimistic person. When the whole world says things are going bad, I do read the news. I have read about how the world was, we have seen barbaric times. We are a lot more polished now. We have the exposure to news today. We get to know of what is happening anywhere in the world at the click of a button. What you see is what it is. You build your opinions about what you see around you. There are a lot of people who lead their lives happily with even a `5,000 in their pocket, and there are other with crores in their bank accounts are and still unhappy. We live in a world of false perceptions too, where we portray our lives to the world in a way we think we should be seen. When you don’t enjoy the small little pleasures that life offers you, you will say the world is not good. When you do the opposite, everything will start becoming good. Enjoy the process, don’t ponder about the outcome. Happiness is a state of mind.

Yes, there are crimes. We have to stand for the right and fight against what is not right. And the government needs to bring in change as well. There are issues that we as individuals need to correct as well. For instance, in an organisation, the attitude of the organisation trickles down to the attitude of the employees and vice versa. If something is wrong with the system, it will affect everyone in the system. We create this system, and we are in a position to make that change. One should have that sense of pride for one’s own country and be the change you want to see. India needs to come out of all the inhibitions and issues. Every country has gone through different crises and have overcome them. I read about this shoe company in Japan, wherein the workers of this company decided to go on a protest. They did not stop production, instead, they manufactured only one shoe out of a pair, till their demands were met. So, while they were protesting, they did not waste time with no production, but still conveyed their message and made the required impact. We should look at protests that will bring in results rather than waste time and energy.


You have KGF2 coming up this year. What’s next?

KGF2 is coming out really well, we are trying to raise the bar. When people give you that kind of success, it does not mean you can sit back and relax. It means that they are expecting more out of you. People have given us that kind of strength and responsibility. While KGF2 is going to be massive, my next work after that has to be something beyond that or something entirely different. I have a few stories I want to work on. But I will wait for another two months before zeroing in on one.


Do you have political aspirations?

I honestly don’t know about that. I do take up responsibilities, by nature I do have leadership qualities. I do not point fingers. I always say what can I do to make things better. Maybe that quality has made people assume or think that I might pursue a career in politics. As an artiste, people have given me a certain amount of power through which I can bring about change. Today, I am able to reach out to more people than a politician would be able to – at least regarding certain issues. So, what I can do now, I will do it. I am not someone who says I don’t like politics, it’s a dirty game. But at the same time, I am not excited about it, at least for now. I don’t mind doing it, but only if it is required. If someone else is doing it, I am happy to cheer for them and support them. Right now, I am very happy to be staying away and letting someone else do it."

Bangalore Times gets chatty with city students to know their take on New Year resolutions.
‘Resolutions keep you motivated to achieve goals’
Talking about New Year resolutions, Diwas Kaushik, a third-year student at New Horizon College, shares that he has already achieved a major career goal because of making a New Year resolution and sticking to it. “I had resolved to perform as an actor on a public platform and I managed to achieve that goal within a year. I made it to the finale of Times Fresh Face. So, I definitely believe in New Year resolutions. They motivate you to achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself. Now, my resolution for 2020 is to become fit and strong,” he adds.

‘It’s better to set practical resolutions’

While some students are ambitious when it comes to setting goals, others think it’s easier to stick to resolutions if they’re practical. Hanisha Sanjay, a third-year student from Mount Carmel College, says, “A good rule of thumb is to start with small goals or changes that can be achieved easily. Those who set goals that are difficult to achieve, like losing an excessive amount of weight or travelling to several destinations, may end up feeling disappointed if they’re unable to achieve them. It can also divert their attention from other important tasks.”

‘New Year shouldn't be the only time to set goals’

Milind Francis, a third year student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous), believes that a New Year or the first day of the year, shouldn’t be the only day for setting goals. “It doesn’t make sense to make resolutions on a particular day. It can be made at any time. It depends on how strong your resolve is to achieve your goal,” says Milind.


‘Resolutions are important for social media influencers’

Apart from achieving goals, what if your resolutions get you more social media content? Nishat Sheikh, a first year MBA student at Manipal University, believes that New Year resolutions matter the most to students who have a major chunk of their personal lives online. “I have seen many social media influencers and vloggers make resolutions and they even achieve their tasks by the end of the year. They are involved in tasks like fitness, travel to reading books or watching a film a day, and so on. Apart from actually completing their tasks, they get a lot of content for their social media handles too,” says Nishat.


Most popular New Year resolutions among students
Fitness goals: Many students like to improve their health and fitness by planning their workout schedule for the entire year.
Becoming more organised: Students, who have a messy room, closet or a cluttered study table, often resolve to change their habits, says Nishat.
Quitting an addiction: From quitting bad habits like eating junk food to smoking, many students said this resolution is a popular one.
Traveling to new destinations: Nishat believes that apart from being a social media favourite, this resolution is also popular among groups of friends in colleges.
Academic goals: According to Hanisha, this is an important resolution for those who are graduating, as it helps them set a clear path for their career."

The young musician started out as a sound engineer with Hiphop Tamizha when they’d just started and went on to sing for them in several films. And now, when he’s turned composer with Odavum Mudiyahu Oliyavum Mudiyadhu, he’s got Hiphop Adhi to sing for him!

“It’s a fast-paced kuthu song, and is the title track of the film. Adhi anna sung it for us recently at his studio,” says Kaushik, who’s sung numbers like Kannala Kannala (Thani Oruvan), Enna Nadanthalum (Meesaya Murukku), Kadhalikathey (Imaikkaa Nodigal) and Hi Sonna Pothum (Comali).


So, how was it to get Adhi to record for him? “I’ve known Adhi anna since the time Hiphop Tamizha was formed and we’ve sung and jammed together so many times. He treats me like his brother, and without expecting anything, he recorded this for us. It was very easy for him, to sing this song. We’ve earlier done Kadhalikathey in kuthu style. This one is also fast-paced like that. So, nanga rendu perum jolly-a jam panni, we finished recording within 45 minutes. Saravedi Saran, a gaana singer, has penned this song.”

The film, starring V Sathyamurthi, Eruma Saani fame Vijay and Harija, RJ Vignesh, Madras Central fame Gopi and Sudhakar, Yashika Aannand and Rythvika among others, is being directed by Ramesh Venkat (of Eruma Saani). “There are five songs in the album, including a theme number. And we’ve recorded all those four songs with live instruments and not gone the techno way. Other than Adhi anna, Shakthisree Gopalan has recorded a song, which is about a mother singing about her yet-to-be-born child. It’s been written by director Ramesh. While Sudharshan and Padmalatha have sung a love track, I’ve rendered a character introduction song, which has lyrics by Mirchi Vijay,” he signs off."

In a candid chat with Bangalore Times, Bindhu, who was honoured with a Filmfare trophy earlier this month, reflects on her musical journey in the past 10 years, her equation with her husband, musician Vasu Dixit, and more. Excerpts:
Looking back at the past decade, how would you describe your journey?
This decade has been a huge milestone — from being a graphic designer, I became a full-time musician. Before finding my true calling, I had completed two bachelor’s degrees and two master’s degrees. But something seemed lacking. I wanted to find a purpose in life, and that’s why, I journeyed back to music. For me, music is magic. It’s more than just an inherent skill. It helped me heal. And there has been no looking back since. I am very proud of my body of work in the past 10 years and thankful for the acknowledgement and recognition that I have received so far, as well as the wonderful collaborations that have come my way.

Your music also resonates social causes, particularly women empowerment. Tell us more about it…
It has been an organic process. And I am glad that my work has shaped up like this. Perhaps, when filmmakers work on women-centric subjects, they believe that women can do justice in terms of the creative output as well. And, I guess, that is how the makers of Aruvi and Nathicharami chose me to direct music for both the films). Similarly, while working on her documentary, titled Survey Number Zero, director Priya Thuvassery shared a post on social media, expressing that she was looking to work with an all-women crew. Someone tagged me on that post, and that’s how I got to work with her.
The works of all those who I have collaborated with — including Ananya Kasaravalli, MD Pallavi, Vedanth Bharadwaj and Ankit Chadha — engaged with life in different ways, and associating with them has enabled me to create interesting content. It helped me go back to the core of where all things begin, and has helped with my journey of self-discovery, too.
When I hear people say that something in my music moves them or heals them, I realise that one cannot cheat on something like that. If we stay authentic to the process, others experience what we are trying to convey.

The past decade also marks 10 years of your marriage with artiste Vasu Dixit…
Through my journey, Vasu has been a constant source of support, and his intense passion to constantly create music inspires me. He has helped in nurturing the artiste in me and, at the same time, stay honest to my craft.

When we started off on our journey together, it was understood that I would be the one keeping things stable with my graphic designing job, while he pursued music. But that changed when I made the career shift. It was quite a jolt, we wondered how we would manage. However, thanks to our commitment and dedication to working things out, we overcame all the challenges we faced.


Is there a Vasu-Bindhu collaboration on the cards?

I used to be quite insistent on collaborating with Vasu, but he ensured that we both took our time to get there. We were both striving to find our identities. Now that we have both found our footing, we are slowly gearing up for our collaboration. Although, we do have casual jamming sessions.


What’s your New Year resolution?

On the personal front, I want to pay more attention to my health and fitness, and would also like to spend more time with my family, and indulge in some me-time. Professionally, I want to dedicate more time to practise music and build material for more musical experiments."

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,Bengaluru students wish for peace and a greener planet,"2019 was mostly about the youth voicing their opinions. As we step into the new decade, students in Bengaluru are poised to make themselves heard not just on the campus but outside, too. They are determined to take bold initiatives and bring about a positive change in society. Here’s what they have to say…
‘The student community will be more active socio-politically in the new decade’
With several students leading protests across the country, those in Bengaluru feel that this generation will be the voice of reason in the next 10 years too. “Youngsters are more likely to actively participate in India’s socio-political campaigns. And the country’s current scenario testifies that,” says Anushka Madhukar, a student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous).


‘Educational institutions should nurture free thinking’ When it comes to allowing them to speak their mind, students also expect educational institutions to be more liberal in the new year. “This will enable youngsters to become better leaders of tomorrow,” says Anagha TV, a student of Mount Carmel College. On the contrary, she also wants the protests to end soon. “It’s been going on for so long that I want it to end now,” she adds.


Students will be the climate warriors of the new decade

Given the intensity with which climate change-related topics were discussed last year, students think that the new decade, too, will be dedicated to saving the environment. “I am, personally, very worried about our degrading environment. This new decade will determine how our future will unfold. It’s encouraging to see that more and more youngsters are coming together to voice their concern over the rising pollution levels and global warming. It’s a cause that needs to be backed both by the government and the people. And, I see that happening today among students,” says Ushua Prashant, a student from Mount Carmel College.


According to Malini Pai N — a student of Christ (deemed-to-be) University — the environment will continue to be the focal point in the new decade. “We have witnessed devastating forest fires and other natural calamities, indicating that we’re on the brink of something irreversible. Little has been done so far to protect the planet, but I hope that things will take a better turn in the new decade,” she says.


Ensuring mental and physical well-being

Another concern that the student community has been trying to attract everyone’s attention to is mental well-being. “I don’t want to see more hatred and anxiety in society. These only lead to depression among youngsters,” asserts Ushua. Aditya DN — a student of Jain (deemed-to-be) University, Centre for Management Studies — says that maintaining one’s physical and mental balance amid all the chaos around is difficult. “I want to work towards my goals, and for that I need to keep myself fit and have a positive approach in life,” he says adding, “I want to make the most of 2020 and do not want to waste my time on unnecessary things. If all of us put our collective energy into something good and productive, it will make us and everyone around us happy.”"

There was angst in her voice when she was eliminated from the house for the first time. But this time around, she’s walked out of the house with peace of mind, and also claims to have made friends during her stay.

“It wasn’t like I walked into the house again, after the two-week break, with an agenda. After being eliminated the first time, I got to see how the show is followed and where I was going wrong. Hence, this time, I told myself that I wouldn’t not keep to myself or stay quiet. This has, in a way, helped me know many people personally,” she says.


But the second stint, Chaitra claims, has made her a happier person. “After the first elimination, I walked out of the house feeling wronged, and also had many things left to be expressed. This time around, though, I found peace and closure, and also made friends inside the house. And I hope that these friendships will continue even outside the house. I am fond of Shine Shetty, Vasuki Vaibhav, Bhoomi Shetty and Chandana, and I want to collaborate with each one on creative projects,” Chaitra explains, adding, “They might have nominated me this week, but that is the nature of the game and I do not hold it against them. I’m sure my name was taken because I didn’t stay in the house through the entire duration. And that’s fair enough.”

While there was an urgency in her starting to work on projects before she went back into the house, Chaitra says that now she is in no hurry. “I want to do good films, and enact better characters. I also want to direct a film. For now, though, I’m taking a two-week break,” she sums up."

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,Are you suffering from that ‘January 1 morning-after’ heel pain?,"Okay, so you’re all partied out after a wild night yesterday. That revelry has probably left you with more than a bunch of fun memories. If you have woken up with feet that feel like a ton of bricks or are finding yourself nursing an inflammation or throbbing ache in your ankles, then there’s a name for it — it’s called a ‘high heel hangover’. This is termed as that after-partying foot pain that you suffer after a long night of being in your stilettos — walking around or dancing, and it’s what most people suffer especially on January 1. And guess what, it’s not to be taken lightly. Those who have been there, done that, share their foot woes and a few ways to help you return from high-heel hell…
Mumbaikars have tried everything from foot soaks to bath salts



For Goregaon-based IT expert Harshita Shah, January 1 is spent at home on account of foot pain from the night before. “I always suffer from a high heel hangover after partying, with swollen ankles, foot soreness and immense pain. So much so, that since last year, as soon as I get home after the party, I apply balm on my feet and soak them, too. This ritual is as important to me as my make-up removing mantra. Nevertheless, I still wake up with painful feet. I love my heels — the higher the heels, the better the look, so since I am not going to give them up, I am finding new ways to deal with it,” she says.

Adds advertising professional Ziana Wadia, “Although I love wearing high heels, I wear them only for parties or weddings because of the strain they cause on the feet and back. I try and wear silicone pads to give my feet some cushioning. I wore my fave stilettos on December 31 and the day after that, I soaked my feet in a tub of hot water and some aromatic bath salts, and massaged them as this practice this gives me a lot of relief. I also carry a pair of flats along on a night out, in case I need to remove my heels for some time; it helps.”
Foot experts share a few words of caution



Says orthopaedic foot and ankle reconstructive surgeon Dr Abhishek Kini, “High heel pain is not to be taken lightly. I tell people that any injury that arises out of it, such as ankle twisting, should not be ignored. Toes getting cramped is another common issue that women face. What happens is when you squeeze your foot into high heels, it places a load on one point rather than on the entire foot. This causes an overload, which can lead to a stress fracture. Prolonged high heel use can also cause behind the heel of the foot and calves.” He shares a tip so that the feet do not cramp the next morning. “One of the easiest home remedies is to stretch the calves well and flex the foot by opening out the toes. Do this before you sleep. Remember, this is marathon season with people already training for it. Any further strain such as wearing heels at a party for long duration adds to the risk of a stress fracture at this time.”
Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Miten Sheth says cutting down on heel-wearing time may help. “There are a lot of complaints about foot pain after a long night of partying in heels. Our advice is to wear the heels for a short duration in case you can’t completely avoid them,” he advises.


3 FOOT PICK-ME-UPS TO TRY
Rubber ball massage



To relive foot and heel pain, place a tennis ball or a rubber ball under the foot and roll it gently. This loosens up the foot and gets rid of plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous tissue along the bottom of the foot). Roll each leg for one minute.


Thumb massage



Sit and cross one leg over the other. Using both thumbs, apply pressure along the length of your foot (underneath). Use gentle but steady pressure and work towards the toes. Repeat for the other leg.


Bottle massage
This simple trick can be done with a bottle that has been frozen in the refrigerator. Sit on a chair and place the frozen bottle underfoot. Do a back and forth rolling motion until you feel relaxed."
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Akash Wadhwa,TV,We spent the New Year’s eve with our son Sartaj in Lucknow: Aditi Sharma and Sarwar Ahuja,"Lucknow girl and actress Aditi Sharma and her hubby actor Sarwar Ahuja ushered in the New Year by spending the night with the new entrant in the family, their son Sartaj. The couple was recently blessed with a son who was delivered at a hospital in Lucknow. “This New Year Eve was really special for us since we got to spend it with out little Krishna, our Sartaj. We have always spent the New Year’s Eve with our friends in Mumbai, partying. But this time it was just the three of us and my parents, having a gala time watching this little angel in our life, who has completely changed our lives,” shared an elated Aditi, getting emotional. Adding, Sarwar said, “Sartaj is actually awake the whole night -- I mean he sleeps the whole day and he is awake the whole night till 6 am. So, we played with him the whole night.” Ask daddy Sarwar on how life has changed post fatherhood and he said, “Life has changed a lot but in a good way. Our whole life now revolves around Sartaj. Taking care of his needs, guessing why he is crying, timing the changing of diapers, every conversation now revolves around him. Another good change that I have observed personally in me over this month is that I have become more caring about my parents. I have realised that in old age, parents too become like kids and they need to be taken care of just like the babies.”

Although life has now become a routine for the couple looking after their son, but Aditi explains that things actually didn’t go as per the plan for the two of them as Sartaj was born three weeks before the due date. “I always used to tell Sarwar that I want you to be there by my side when the baby arrives and as per the plan he had got his tickets booked a day before the due date. But things changed at the last minute.”

“The only regret I have is that I was not there with Aditi when all this happened. I really wanted to feel the first moment when Sartaj came into this world. But three weeks before the due date, I get a call from Aditi saying that the doctor has called her to the hospital,” said Sarwar, adding, “Every minute I was getting the updates and within an hour or so I got the news that we have had a baby boy. I took a flight the same night and as luck would have it, I missed my connecting flight as it got cancelled and it was after a lot of jaddo-jehad that I managed to reach the hospital,” said Sarwar.

And while Aditi was hesitant to carry the baby in her arms, Sarwar has proved to be quite a pro. “Sarwar is actually quite good with kids though I am scared of carrying newborns. It is only when I started holding him for the mother’s feed that I became okay and a bit comfortable. The last newborn I carried in my lap was my own brother’s baby that too when I was seven years old. Woh bhi bed ke centre mein baitha ke I held him. But that was way back. Before Sartaj was born, I would ask everyone ki main itne chhote baby ko kaise pakdungi and then I would get that same reply ki sab kuchh apne aap aa jayega, don’t worry. And I used to be like ki achha...okay, let’s wait and watch,” said Aditi with a laugh.
Sarwar with his son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

So did the two of them wish for a boy? “Well, to be frank we just prayed for a healthy baby and were really okay with both the genders. But yes, our friends in Mumbai were really excited to guess the gender. I remember how at Aditi’s baby shower, half of our friends who thought it will be a girl, wore pink and the ones who wanted it to be a boy, wore blue and there was a tug of war between them. It was really fun to see them being so excited for the baby’s arrival. More so, because in our group of friends, we are the first ones to have a baby,” said Sarwar.

Ask them how life has changed post Sartaj’s arrival and Sarwar is quick to add, “Life has changed so much! Before we had a baby, both Aditi and I were living a nomadic life. Making plans in the night, travelling to different places, partying till the wee hours but all that will change now,” shared Sarwar, adding “We have been married for six years now and we took our time to transition into the next phase of our life – parenthood. I remember whenever Aditi used to say to me that we should plan a child, I always used to tell her that we will whenever she is ready to have one. In fact, the same reply used to be to everyone in our family who asked us about when we were planning to start a family. I was very clear on this that I wanted Aditi to be ready for motherhood as most of the changes will by default come in her life – personally and professionally. She was right now at the peak of her career.”

So was Aditi prepared for motherhood, we asked. “Yes, I was very sure. I think this was the right time for us to become parents. I was mentally prepared for the new phase of our life. Motherhood is a really beautiful feeling but one has to be ready for it. I remember getting to know I have conceived while I was shooting for my Punjabi film which will release next year. I also thankfully fulfilled all my professional commitments and now I can peacefully enjoy motherhood. Also, during the process I realised that real-life motherhood is really different from a reel one. I have played a mother and a pregnant women several times on screen. For that, I used to observe a lot of pregnant ladies but real life mein experience was completely hatt ke.”

So has she decided on how long the break from work is going to be? “Well, I haven’t planned anything as such. Let’s see since work commitment on television is really long. After a few months, I will be working towards making a comeback. But as of now, we are really excited for Sartaj’s first Lohri celebrations which will be in Hyderabad, in Sarwar’s hometown. It will be a big day for all of us,” said she."
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Melissa D'costa,Lifestyle,Are you hungover today? Fix it with a heavy breakfast,"Welcome to the New Year, and if you are guilty of downing one too many shots the night before, chances of you waking up with a hangover are high. It can be a challenge to get through the day with a headache and not everyone is adept at battling through the nauseous state. However, it helps to pay heed to what experts have to say about it. Dietician Sheela Tanna advises you to take a dotshot the night before as that supposedly helps you wake up the next morning minus a hangover. She adds, “If you have overindulged, then you must be prepared to deal with the repercussions the morning after. A throbbing headache is just one of the fallouts, but a hearty breakfast can help you deal with some of the aftereffects. Waffles with butter and maple syrup, eggs, fruits and a combination of carbohydrates and fats are known to help combat the hangover the following morning. Also, liquids other than water should be avoided to keep that feeling of nausea at bay.” Make a note of your drinks and Don’t mix them to avoid a hangover
Limit the quantity of alcohol intake at one time. Consume it slowly instead of downing shots one after the other. Keep yourself hydrated and do not drink on an empty stomach. No matter what the temptation, avoid mixing your alcohol. Stick with beer and wine as they are the safest bets to avoid any kind of hangover provided they are consumed in moderation. Don’t mix vodka with whiskey as you will end up with a bad headache. Fruit and vegetable juices are better mixes for your drinks instead of soda because of the extra vitamins in the former. Avoid fried foods with booze, and do not mix alcohol with medication. Opt for protein and fiber rich foods with your drinks.

Make a note of this...
Avoid tequila Alcohol such as tequila and whiskey has high level of methanol and hence, high congener present in it causes a bad hangover. So, if you are looking to consume alcohol that doesn’t give a hangover, opt for vodka, gin or rum. According to mixologist Latesh Kotian a vodka/rum-based cocktail without sugar and with antioxidants, vitamin C and potassium gives a hangover-free morning after.

Antioxidants in your cocktails can help
Drinking alcohol induces oxidative stress, whose effect can be reduced by using antioxidants. The use of natural antioxidant ingredients like saffron, turmeric, beetroot reduction and mulled cucumber can help fight this oxidative stress.

Opt for fresh fruit juices to flavour your cocktails
Use fresh orange juice, lemon, pineapple, etc, which provides flavour and vitamin C, that your body needs.

Use ingredients rich in potassium
Use of potassium rich ingredients like banana, orange, cucumber, grapefruit, coconut water, etc helps in retaining water content in the body, when alcohol dehydrates the body.

Keep natural sugar at hand
Using natural or simple sugar will help reduce the hangover.

,"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Lifestyle,Why we should talk about sustainable living,"According to a CPCB estimate from 2012, India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day. This is close to the weight of 9,000 Asian elephants. Worse, a little over 10,000 tonnes a day of plastic waste remains uncollected, which eventually ends up in the natural environment - in our seas and oceans or piling up on our lands. The plastic processing industry is estimated to grow to 22 million tonnes (MT) a year by 2020 from 13.4 MT in 2015 and nearly half of this is single-use plastic, according to a Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry study.

By 2050, the amount of plastic in seas and oceans across the world will weigh more than the fishes, says an estimate by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.


Quoting Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reports, TERI states that plastic contributes to 8% of the total solid waste collected in the country. Households generate maximum plastic waste, of which water and soft drink bottles form the bulk.

77% of people in the US and Australia want to learn how to live more sustainably – the data collected showed that 93% of all surveyed indicated a general concern for the environment with plastic pollution (40.1%), biodiversity loss (39.1%), and climate change (38%) deemed the top three issues. Both the US and Australia have been dealing with these problems, with climate change notably being blamed for the record-setting wildfires in California as well as the major bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef.

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Anupam V Kapil,Lifestyle,2020: What the numbers predict for India,"Here are astro-numerologist Anupam V Kapil’s predictions for the country
Born on August 15, 1947, India is ruled by number 8 (Saturn). In its 73rd year, it will be ruled by number 9 (Mars). The country’s fate number is 6, which is ruled by Venus and its destiny number is 8. Number 6 is a peace-loving number and Number 8 is the tough karmic task master of destiny.
At the moment, India is ruled by Narendra Modi, born on 17 September 1950, with fate number 8.


As India enters its 73rd year, a solar eclipse in India’s 8th house will involve Sun, Moon and Jupiter (planet of economy) being caught between Rahu and Ketu. This brings enhanced fears and uncertainty. India will go through personal year number 9 in 2020, which indicates closing of a nine-year cycle. Many methods/laws/customs might be abrogated. Though Number 9 is a painful vibration, the Universal vibration of 2020 is 4, which will force the governments across the world to create a new roadmap, foundation and structure to work in a disciplined way. Number 4 brings substantial progress in educational and commercial affairs. But all these good things will start happening only after September, when the engineering and auto sector shall start reviving slowly. The future will be of hydrogen, not of electric sector.
The commercial truck segment shall take about two years to revive. New-age technologies discovered in 2020 and evolution of artificial intelligence will change the way businesses will be done in future.

For the purpose of numerology, life is divided in to three periods: The digit corresponding with the month controls the first 27 years. For India, this month is August or Number 8. Saturn ruled from 1947 to 1974, during which we saw wars with Pakistan, China and Bangladesh.

The second phase is governed by the birthday digit. For India, born on 15th, this digit is 6. So we had Venus ruling India for the next 27 years, from 1975 to 2002. This phase saw an increase in comforts but also wars and political assassinations due to an afflicted Venus in the 3rd house.

From 2002 onwards, we are again being run by Number 8. Also, Jupiter will move temporarily in India’s ninth house in Capricorn and retrograde between May and September this year. It will act as an exalted planet, and by aspecting the 3rd house, it will increase the expenditure on army, railways and religious institutions. Major changes in judicial framework will be seen.



A repeat of the dangerous Saturn-Pluto conjunction

A dangerous affliction of Pluto, the 10th lord of India’s Independence chart, is happening right now in India’s eighth house and will continue till mid-January 2020. Last time this happened was when there was civil unrest in Punjab. But slow planet conjunctions don’t give immediate results. Accidents and conspiracies are also foreseen when Mars crosses natal Ketu in the 7th house and meets transit Ketu and Jupiter in the 8th house in February."

"Updated: Jun 29, 2020, 00:35 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,Allergy cases on the rise in Bengaluru,"Have you been suffering from cough, throat congestion, nasal discharge or itchy nose? If you’ve been complaining of any of these symptoms, chances are that you’ve fallen prey to allergens around you. Bengaluru has been witnessing a rise in allergy cases and the problem has affected many residents in the city. BT talks to experts to find out the reasons for the spike in such cases and how to keep them at bay...

Most patients suffer from nasal allergies
Apart from the city’s erratic weather, experts point to the depleting air quality — indoor and outdoor — as the reason for the spike in such cases, especially around this time of the year. On average, city clinics and hospitals record approximately 20 allergic rhinitis, allergic rashes and eczema cases every day. Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, a city-based lung specialist, says, “At least 50% of my outpatient cases comprise nasal allergies and most of the patients come when their condition is worse. This is a common problem, especially during winter.”


Dust mites and pollen trigger allergies
“Seasonal allergies mostly occur because of dust mites, animal dander (such as fur or dead skin cells of animals) and cockroach droppings, etc. Mold, too, causes seasonal allergies. Symptoms include sneezing, wheezing and itching in the eyes. In Bengaluru, pollen from flowering trees add to the problem. It is suggested to avoid exposure to known triggers. One can use humidifiers to minimise allergies,” advises Dr S Manohar, an Internal Medicine specialist at a city hospital. Dr Gayathri Pandit, Consultant ENT surgeon and Allergy Specialist, explains, “House dust mites are often called asthamogenic allergen. It is a major cause of combined upper and lower respiratory allergy. It is also a common first allergen sensitivity to be seen in children. In the skin-prick allergy test that we conduct, nearly 75% to 80% comprise house dust mite allergy. It’s also the main respiratory allergen, contributing to nearly 75% of sensitivity. At least, 20% allergies are caused by pollens — Parthenium, Amaranthus Spinosus, Prosopis Juliflora, Ricinus Communis and castor oil plant. These may lead to respiratory illness.”

Poor air quality aggravates allergies
The rising pollution levels in Bengaluru also aggravate the problem. “Apart from pollen, the drop in air quality, because of construction, dust, fume and emissions from vehicles, also trigger allergies. With clouds trapping all the allergens and pollutants, the condition can worsen for many people. Poor air quality can make asthma and allergies worse,” explains Dr Vivek."

The decade gone by has done the needful and given the film industry one. Today, Yash is not just a star in the Kannada film industry, but is one who is recognised beyond language and geographical boundaries. It is, incidentally, this very vision that this youngster set out with 10 years ago. For this artiste, who makes no bones about calling himself a businessman at the core, changing mindsets — of his audience, the people he works with and most importantly, his own, have been the most challenging aspect of his journey. “There are only a few things such as one’s health, accidents etc., that is beyond one’s control. For everything else, hard work and perseverance can make anything possible,” he states. Inspiring? Well, that is just the beginning. At the onset of a new decade today, here’s decoding the man who has become the kind of star that many often dream about…
How has your journey over this last decade been, how has it shaped the person you are today?
The decade has been wonderful. The first best thing that happened to me over the last decade was the fact that I met Radhika (Pandit), my wife. Our relationship started around 2011, I think I was shooting for my film Lucky at that time. So, on the personal front (with regards to love, marriage, and children), it has been wonderful. On the professional front, the commercial success that my films Kirataka and Lucky achieved sort of set the path ahead during the initial years of the decade. I have always believed that whatever you do will become a stepping stone in your career — whether it was good or bad. I do believe everything happens for the good. Every incident or action has a lot of points that help you chalk out your way forward. Even if there is something that you see as a bad episode, it does give you an opportunity to learn from it. One must always take everything in a very positive way. When I look back, I have had a positive mindset and a bit of aggression. I didn’t think of it in the form of a decade as such, but every year I focused on being better and bigger. I knew there was a lot within me, to explore, to understand.

I do believe everything happens for the good. I believe that the whole world is on this journey with you and is looking at you. When you want to achieve something, you have to first convince yourself that it is possible, and you need to be crazy about it. You have to believe that it is going to happen, and it will happen eventually.
What role does god or destiny play in how a person’s life turns out?
God has a plan, that is there. But you don’t change your field when you are looking for that path or destiny. One decade is a very long time for one to be able to create something out of your life in your profession. If you spend 10 years working passionately, in any profession, eventually you will end up being something. To be able to stay on and survive there itself is a big thing.
To sustain, in spite of all the difficulties and problems that come with the job and still stick on — not doing the same old thing, but keep on improving and bettering yourself while at it — eventually, you will end up being something you would be proud of. Personally speaking, I can say that yes, today — whatever I am today is because of the work that I have put in over the last decade.

The past year has been crucial in terms of change for you to a large extent, thanks to KGF. In fact, it has changed the positioning of Kannada cinema in the world of cinema. Tell us about this journey.
Kannada films have always been there. But there was an issue with the mind set of our people about our industry. I used to feel really bad, especially when you see other industry being respected in the state. When it comes to IT, they say Bengaluru is the IT city. When it is about fashion, they say Bengaluru is one of the best in the field. We excel in English and Kannada theatre, we win so many awards for literature. Kannadigas were proud about so many of these things, except Kannada films. They would say, Kannada is a small industry, it has its limitations. At that point, I felt, I am here and people have given me the chance or an opportunity to make a difference. And when I have that kind of power where I can bring in a change, if I don’t do anything about it, or if I don’t even try, I will be a failure.
As far as KGF is concerned, I have always brought in this comparison. Look at our soldiers, they go to war. Irrespective of whether he wins or he dies, a soldier will always be respected. So, like that, I always felt, we are soldiers. We had to do this to fight for our respect. In this process, I figured that perception and mindsets were the main issue. To tackle that, I started talking positive. I started building an atmosphere around me where I told everybody that it is changing. When you start thinking about good things, or when you start imagining good things, when you say that something good is going to happen, you are excited about something, you will then start focusing only on those good things and you will somehow get there. I started putting that thought into the minds of people around me. Soon, my producers started thinking, ‘yes, we can change.’ If one person believes in something, and others around this person see that there is a positive change and that it is working, then will follow you. There was a point when after I had said something positive, a day or two later, someone else would come to me and tell me the same thing. That’s how I knew it was working. So, first you have to convince yourself and then you need to bring in change. There is the whole idea of law of attraction — yes, it does work. In my life, it has happened. During this process, I tried stretching the market, brought in new quality, and eventually brought in competition. If there is no competition, the market is not good. Why do we compete? We compete because there is potential. I wanted this kind of competition, because where there is competition, the quality goes high. When the quality goes up, people start noticing.
There was a time when people, including friends of mine, were not willing to say ‘we watch Kannada films’. It was not cool to say so. It was important to address that mindset. If my own friends are telling me that they do not watch Kannada films, but were keen on watching other regional films, we had to relook at what was lacking. From the technicalities involved, to the budgets for a film, or even the styling, there are a lot of elements involved. We started identifying and recognising talents. I worked with the younger crop in various departments. I did not work with seniors in the field, because what happens is they already have their way around their work that has brought them success. They would not want to change that equation that has been working for them. With youngsters, there is a sense of open-mindedness where was keen on exploring. I also had Jayanna as a producer who believed in me. He produced five of my films back-to-back. Each time, the budget went higher than the previous one. We were constantly exploring and experimenting with new things.
In the market too, in the borders of the south states, they were not playing Kannada films. That changed too, coincidentally though. It was the time when there was a brief ban on Telugu film screenings during the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana issue. At that time, screens in these areas started approaching us for our films. As luck would have it, two or three films of mine were out around that time. I gave them Googly and Raja Huli on the condition that if the ban is off soon, they cannot remove my film if there is a demand for it. These were well-maintained theatres that usually only played films of other languages. And our films being screened there worked for us. Once they got familiar with our work, my next film also was received in a big way in that area. That is how I stretched my market. There was extra revenue coming in from all these areas, we directed that towards our next films to raise the bar yet again in terms of bringing in quality. All of this was the process where we started building and restructuring the way we work on our films while addressing all the issues that were identified. We started working with talent, some of our writers turned directors — be it Santosh Anandram or Manju Mandavya. Honestly, I cannot claim to be the only person who brought about a change here, but these are some of the issues that I personally noticed and started addressing.

Do you see a change in the way people from other states see you today?
I had been to a couple of award ceremonies before where I had noticed a sort of discrimination towards Kannada films and actors here. I believe that there is nothing called big industry or small industry. People who work there make it big or small. Karnataka is rich in everything, we have the resources, we have our people who love our culture. I felt that attitude towards us was not right. If you start competing with your neighbouring states, you will end up making films that are just about up to that standard. Our aim should be to compete with world cinema. Luckily, my director Prashant Neel had the vision and talent to see it through, my producer Vijay Kiran, has the kind of passion and resource to facilitate the same. Incidentally, KGF was not made for pan India. It was a film for Karnataka. While filming it, I realised it had the potential to be a pan-India film. Prashant was sceptical. To be honest, he is not happy with what he has done with KGF Chapter 1. What he is doing in KGF 2, you will see a pan-India film.
Today, I am happy with the way people talk about our industry. I think I have helped push towards that change at least partially. It was about changing mindset. For instance, you see people jumping signals. That happens, not because there is a lack of policing, but because people believe they can get away with it. We need to break that mindset. Today, when it comes to Kannada cinema, people are stretching their limits, aiming to produce quality work. The audience is expanding too, and people who do not even know the language here now ask about Kannada films they can check out.

Kannada films have had to find space for themselves amidst competition from other language films being released here in Karnataka. Has Pan-India releases of films from here changed the way we look at competition?
There was a point when we would think so much about when we could release our films. There was always an attempt to release films when no other big releases from other industries were posing a threat to our market. If you go back and check history, I have released my films on the same day as some of the bigger and promising Bollywood films. I was confident about my product, I tried. At the end the day, if both the films are good, people with watch both. If our film is good, it will never be deprived. People will come and watch it and they did. Now, nobody is worried about which other language film is releasing in Karnataka. Now, the other industries have to think about when they release their films in our state. That itself is a change in the mindset. Instead, we are looking at pan India releases for so many of our films today. Just like how our people have supported other language films here before, their people are now supporting our films in their states. It is no more regional, it is global.

How about competition from within the Kannada film industry?
I respect my competitors because they bring out the best in me. When they say that they are the best, a person like me will say — okay, hold on, you don’t know what’s in store, what’s coming. I respect them they do a good job and I enjoy it when they are successful. I enjoy their success. But I also say, watch out. If I start feeling that they should fail, then I will fail. Imagine there is a race, where everybody falls and you win. Can you call yourself a winner? No. I want everyone to run fast. But I want to win that race. Competition is always good, and it is there in our industry now. There are many people and I want many more to come. For our industry to grow and become bigger, we need more heroes. We need more stars, more films that assure you of definite guarantee of success. People say you should be doing at least two movies a year. If a subject demands a shorter period to work on, I will look at it. But as of now, I do not see myself doing that.

A success of one film gives rise to hope, but also gives rise to assumptions about success, attempts to recreate the success. The industry has so many films in a year that release and disappear without a trace. Are people being misled into drowning their investments?
People do get influenced by the success of one film, and they go overboard, and they may end up losing money. But today, there are enough platforms where a bit of strategy and planning will ensure your investment on a movie is safe. The truth is that in film industries worldwide, only a few films make money, not all films make that mark. Still, you cannot discourage people from making that film. So, many people, like me, run away from home to be an actor. Very few survive. But that does not mean you can question or discourage another aspiring actor from pursuing his dreams. As for quality of a film, it is debatable topic. My mother might think I am the most handsome guy on earth. Someone else’s mother may think her son is the most handsome one around. A film is one’s baby. You do get carried away, but that’s how the trade is. What works today may not work tomorrow. One should be updated. If I am not updated, I shouldn’t be here. The people who want to come into this industry should do proper research. Nowadays, every Friday every film says they broke all records. That is bullshit. They should project the right figures. Today, things are becoming more transparent, because of GST etc. People are forced to present the correct picture. Because for a layman, or for a newcomer, or a new producer — claims of broken records are misleading and they will not be able to make informed decisions as far as their projects are concerned. I want them to be more careful.

How is the new decade looking for you?
I am a very optimistic person. When the whole world says things are going bad, I do read the news. I have read about how the world was, we have seen barbaric times. We are a lot more polished now. We have the exposure to news today. We get to know of what is happening anywhere in the world at the click of a button. What you see is what it is. You build your opinions about what you see around you. There are a lot of people who lead their lives happily with even a `5,000 in their pocket, and there are other with crores in their bank accounts are and still unhappy. We live in a world of false perceptions too, where we portray our lives to the world in a way we think we should be seen. When you don’t enjoy the small little pleasures that life offers you, you will say the world is not good. When you do the opposite, everything will start becoming good. Enjoy the process, don’t ponder about the outcome. Happiness is a state of mind.

Yes, there are crimes. We have to stand for the right and fight against what is not right. And the government needs to bring in change as well. There are issues that we as individuals need to correct as well. For instance, in an organisation, the attitude of the organisation trickles down to the attitude of the employees and vice versa. If something is wrong with the system, it will affect everyone in the system. We create this system, and we are in a position to make that change. One should have that sense of pride for one’s own country and be the change you want to see. India needs to come out of all the inhibitions and issues. Every country has gone through different crises and have overcome them. I read about this shoe company in Japan, wherein the workers of this company decided to go on a protest. They did not stop production, instead, they manufactured only one shoe out of a pair, till their demands were met. So, while they were protesting, they did not waste time with no production, but still conveyed their message and made the required impact. We should look at protests that will bring in results rather than waste time and energy.


You have KGF2 coming up this year. What’s next?

KGF2 is coming out really well, we are trying to raise the bar. When people give you that kind of success, it does not mean you can sit back and relax. It means that they are expecting more out of you. People have given us that kind of strength and responsibility. While KGF2 is going to be massive, my next work after that has to be something beyond that or something entirely different. I have a few stories I want to work on. But I will wait for another two months before zeroing in on one.


Do you have political aspirations?

I honestly don’t know about that. I do take up responsibilities, by nature I do have leadership qualities. I do not point fingers. I always say what can I do to make things better. Maybe that quality has made people assume or think that I might pursue a career in politics. As an artiste, people have given me a certain amount of power through which I can bring about change. Today, I am able to reach out to more people than a politician would be able to – at least regarding certain issues. So, what I can do now, I will do it. I am not someone who says I don’t like politics, it’s a dirty game. But at the same time, I am not excited about it, at least for now. I don’t mind doing it, but only if it is required. If someone else is doing it, I am happy to cheer for them and support them. Right now, I am very happy to be staying away and letting someone else do it."
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Hansy Sanctis,Lifestyle,Strong New Year resolutions keep young minds motivated,"As 2020 begins, everyone, including Bengaluru’s college students, are making New Year resolutions in the hope to do better. Bangalore Times gets chatty with city students to know their take on New Year resolutions.
‘Resolutions keep you motivated to achieve goals’
Talking about New Year resolutions, Diwas Kaushik, a third-year student at New Horizon College, shares that he has already achieved a major career goal because of making a New Year resolution and sticking to it. “I had resolved to perform as an actor on a public platform and I managed to achieve that goal within a year. I made it to the finale of Times Fresh Face. So, I definitely believe in New Year resolutions. They motivate you to achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself. Now, my resolution for 2020 is to become fit and strong,” he adds.

‘It’s better to set practical resolutions’

While some students are ambitious when it comes to setting goals, others think it’s easier to stick to resolutions if they’re practical. Hanisha Sanjay, a third-year student from Mount Carmel College, says, “A good rule of thumb is to start with small goals or changes that can be achieved easily. Those who set goals that are difficult to achieve, like losing an excessive amount of weight or travelling to several destinations, may end up feeling disappointed if they’re unable to achieve them. It can also divert their attention from other important tasks.”

‘New Year shouldn't be the only time to set goals’

Milind Francis, a third year student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous), believes that a New Year or the first day of the year, shouldn’t be the only day for setting goals. “It doesn’t make sense to make resolutions on a particular day. It can be made at any time. It depends on how strong your resolve is to achieve your goal,” says Milind.


‘Resolutions are important for social media influencers’

Apart from achieving goals, what if your resolutions get you more social media content? Nishat Sheikh, a first year MBA student at Manipal University, believes that New Year resolutions matter the most to students who have a major chunk of their personal lives online. “I have seen many social media influencers and vloggers make resolutions and they even achieve their tasks by the end of the year. They are involved in tasks like fitness, travel to reading books or watching a film a day, and so on. Apart from actually completing their tasks, they get a lot of content for their social media handles too,” says Nishat.


Most popular New Year resolutions among students
Fitness goals: Many students like to improve their health and fitness by planning their workout schedule for the entire year.
Becoming more organised: Students, who have a messy room, closet or a cluttered study table, often resolve to change their habits, says Nishat.
Quitting an addiction: From quitting bad habits like eating junk food to smoking, many students said this resolution is a popular one.
Traveling to new destinations: Nishat believes that apart from being a social media favourite, this resolution is also popular among groups of friends in colleges.
Academic goals: According to Hanisha, this is an important resolution for those who are graduating, as it helps them set a clear path for their career."

The young musician started out as a sound engineer with Hiphop Tamizha when they’d just started and went on to sing for them in several films. And now, when he’s turned composer with Odavum Mudiyahu Oliyavum Mudiyadhu, he’s got Hiphop Adhi to sing for him!

“It’s a fast-paced kuthu song, and is the title track of the film. Adhi anna sung it for us recently at his studio,” says Kaushik, who’s sung numbers like Kannala Kannala (Thani Oruvan), Enna Nadanthalum (Meesaya Murukku), Kadhalikathey (Imaikkaa Nodigal) and Hi Sonna Pothum (Comali).


So, how was it to get Adhi to record for him? “I’ve known Adhi anna since the time Hiphop Tamizha was formed and we’ve sung and jammed together so many times. He treats me like his brother, and without expecting anything, he recorded this for us. It was very easy for him, to sing this song. We’ve earlier done Kadhalikathey in kuthu style. This one is also fast-paced like that. So, nanga rendu perum jolly-a jam panni, we finished recording within 45 minutes. Saravedi Saran, a gaana singer, has penned this song.”

The film, starring V Sathyamurthi, Eruma Saani fame Vijay and Harija, RJ Vignesh, Madras Central fame Gopi and Sudhakar, Yashika Aannand and Rythvika among others, is being directed by Ramesh Venkat (of Eruma Saani). “There are five songs in the album, including a theme number. And we’ve recorded all those four songs with live instruments and not gone the techno way. Other than Adhi anna, Shakthisree Gopalan has recorded a song, which is about a mother singing about her yet-to-be-born child. It’s been written by director Ramesh. While Sudharshan and Padmalatha have sung a love track, I’ve rendered a character introduction song, which has lyrics by Mirchi Vijay,” he signs off."

In a candid chat with Bangalore Times, Bindhu, who was honoured with a Filmfare trophy earlier this month, reflects on her musical journey in the past 10 years, her equation with her husband, musician Vasu Dixit, and more. Excerpts:
Looking back at the past decade, how would you describe your journey?
This decade has been a huge milestone — from being a graphic designer, I became a full-time musician. Before finding my true calling, I had completed two bachelor’s degrees and two master’s degrees. But something seemed lacking. I wanted to find a purpose in life, and that’s why, I journeyed back to music. For me, music is magic. It’s more than just an inherent skill. It helped me heal. And there has been no looking back since. I am very proud of my body of work in the past 10 years and thankful for the acknowledgement and recognition that I have received so far, as well as the wonderful collaborations that have come my way.

Your music also resonates social causes, particularly women empowerment. Tell us more about it…
It has been an organic process. And I am glad that my work has shaped up like this. Perhaps, when filmmakers work on women-centric subjects, they believe that women can do justice in terms of the creative output as well. And, I guess, that is how the makers of Aruvi and Nathicharami chose me to direct music for both the films). Similarly, while working on her documentary, titled Survey Number Zero, director Priya Thuvassery shared a post on social media, expressing that she was looking to work with an all-women crew. Someone tagged me on that post, and that’s how I got to work with her.
The works of all those who I have collaborated with — including Ananya Kasaravalli, MD Pallavi, Vedanth Bharadwaj and Ankit Chadha — engaged with life in different ways, and associating with them has enabled me to create interesting content. It helped me go back to the core of where all things begin, and has helped with my journey of self-discovery, too.
When I hear people say that something in my music moves them or heals them, I realise that one cannot cheat on something like that. If we stay authentic to the process, others experience what we are trying to convey.

The past decade also marks 10 years of your marriage with artiste Vasu Dixit…
Through my journey, Vasu has been a constant source of support, and his intense passion to constantly create music inspires me. He has helped in nurturing the artiste in me and, at the same time, stay honest to my craft.

When we started off on our journey together, it was understood that I would be the one keeping things stable with my graphic designing job, while he pursued music. But that changed when I made the career shift. It was quite a jolt, we wondered how we would manage. However, thanks to our commitment and dedication to working things out, we overcame all the challenges we faced.


Is there a Vasu-Bindhu collaboration on the cards?

I used to be quite insistent on collaborating with Vasu, but he ensured that we both took our time to get there. We were both striving to find our identities. Now that we have both found our footing, we are slowly gearing up for our collaboration. Although, we do have casual jamming sessions.


What’s your New Year resolution?

On the personal front, I want to pay more attention to my health and fitness, and would also like to spend more time with my family, and indulge in some me-time. Professionally, I want to dedicate more time to practise music and build material for more musical experiments."

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,Bengaluru students wish for peace and a greener planet,"2019 was mostly about the youth voicing their opinions. As we step into the new decade, students in Bengaluru are poised to make themselves heard not just on the campus but outside, too. They are determined to take bold initiatives and bring about a positive change in society. Here’s what they have to say…
‘The student community will be more active socio-politically in the new decade’
With several students leading protests across the country, those in Bengaluru feel that this generation will be the voice of reason in the next 10 years too. “Youngsters are more likely to actively participate in India’s socio-political campaigns. And the country’s current scenario testifies that,” says Anushka Madhukar, a student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous).


‘Educational institutions should nurture free thinking’ When it comes to allowing them to speak their mind, students also expect educational institutions to be more liberal in the new year. “This will enable youngsters to become better leaders of tomorrow,” says Anagha TV, a student of Mount Carmel College. On the contrary, she also wants the protests to end soon. “It’s been going on for so long that I want it to end now,” she adds.


Students will be the climate warriors of the new decade

Given the intensity with which climate change-related topics were discussed last year, students think that the new decade, too, will be dedicated to saving the environment. “I am, personally, very worried about our degrading environment. This new decade will determine how our future will unfold. It’s encouraging to see that more and more youngsters are coming together to voice their concern over the rising pollution levels and global warming. It’s a cause that needs to be backed both by the government and the people. And, I see that happening today among students,” says Ushua Prashant, a student from Mount Carmel College.


According to Malini Pai N — a student of Christ (deemed-to-be) University — the environment will continue to be the focal point in the new decade. “We have witnessed devastating forest fires and other natural calamities, indicating that we’re on the brink of something irreversible. Little has been done so far to protect the planet, but I hope that things will take a better turn in the new decade,” she says.


Ensuring mental and physical well-being

Another concern that the student community has been trying to attract everyone’s attention to is mental well-being. “I don’t want to see more hatred and anxiety in society. These only lead to depression among youngsters,” asserts Ushua. Aditya DN — a student of Jain (deemed-to-be) University, Centre for Management Studies — says that maintaining one’s physical and mental balance amid all the chaos around is difficult. “I want to work towards my goals, and for that I need to keep myself fit and have a positive approach in life,” he says adding, “I want to make the most of 2020 and do not want to waste my time on unnecessary things. If all of us put our collective energy into something good and productive, it will make us and everyone around us happy.”"
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,TV,I found peace and closure during my second stint inside Bigg Boss house: Chaitra Kottoor,"Arguably, one of the most followed contestants on Bigg Boss Kannada Season 7, actress-writer Chaitra Kottoor is known for her stark individuality. There was angst in her voice when she was eliminated from the house for the first time. But this time around, she’s walked out of the house with peace of mind, and also claims to have made friends during her stay.

“It wasn’t like I walked into the house again, after the two-week break, with an agenda. After being eliminated the first time, I got to see how the show is followed and where I was going wrong. Hence, this time, I told myself that I wouldn’t not keep to myself or stay quiet. This has, in a way, helped me know many people personally,” she says.


But the second stint, Chaitra claims, has made her a happier person. “After the first elimination, I walked out of the house feeling wronged, and also had many things left to be expressed. This time around, though, I found peace and closure, and also made friends inside the house. And I hope that these friendships will continue even outside the house. I am fond of Shine Shetty, Vasuki Vaibhav, Bhoomi Shetty and Chandana, and I want to collaborate with each one on creative projects,” Chaitra explains, adding, “They might have nominated me this week, but that is the nature of the game and I do not hold it against them. I’m sure my name was taken because I didn’t stay in the house through the entire duration. And that’s fair enough.”

While there was an urgency in her starting to work on projects before she went back into the house, Chaitra says that now she is in no hurry. “I want to do good films, and enact better characters. I also want to direct a film. For now, though, I’m taking a two-week break,” she sums up."

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,Are you suffering from that ‘January 1 morning-after’ heel pain?,"Okay, so you’re all partied out after a wild night yesterday. That revelry has probably left you with more than a bunch of fun memories. If you have woken up with feet that feel like a ton of bricks or are finding yourself nursing an inflammation or throbbing ache in your ankles, then there’s a name for it — it’s called a ‘high heel hangover’. This is termed as that after-partying foot pain that you suffer after a long night of being in your stilettos — walking around or dancing, and it’s what most people suffer especially on January 1. And guess what, it’s not to be taken lightly. Those who have been there, done that, share their foot woes and a few ways to help you return from high-heel hell…
Mumbaikars have tried everything from foot soaks to bath salts



For Goregaon-based IT expert Harshita Shah, January 1 is spent at home on account of foot pain from the night before. “I always suffer from a high heel hangover after partying, with swollen ankles, foot soreness and immense pain. So much so, that since last year, as soon as I get home after the party, I apply balm on my feet and soak them, too. This ritual is as important to me as my make-up removing mantra. Nevertheless, I still wake up with painful feet. I love my heels — the higher the heels, the better the look, so since I am not going to give them up, I am finding new ways to deal with it,” she says.

Adds advertising professional Ziana Wadia, “Although I love wearing high heels, I wear them only for parties or weddings because of the strain they cause on the feet and back. I try and wear silicone pads to give my feet some cushioning. I wore my fave stilettos on December 31 and the day after that, I soaked my feet in a tub of hot water and some aromatic bath salts, and massaged them as this practice this gives me a lot of relief. I also carry a pair of flats along on a night out, in case I need to remove my heels for some time; it helps.”
Foot experts share a few words of caution



Says orthopaedic foot and ankle reconstructive surgeon Dr Abhishek Kini, “High heel pain is not to be taken lightly. I tell people that any injury that arises out of it, such as ankle twisting, should not be ignored. Toes getting cramped is another common issue that women face. What happens is when you squeeze your foot into high heels, it places a load on one point rather than on the entire foot. This causes an overload, which can lead to a stress fracture. Prolonged high heel use can also cause behind the heel of the foot and calves.” He shares a tip so that the feet do not cramp the next morning. “One of the easiest home remedies is to stretch the calves well and flex the foot by opening out the toes. Do this before you sleep. Remember, this is marathon season with people already training for it. Any further strain such as wearing heels at a party for long duration adds to the risk of a stress fracture at this time.”
Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Miten Sheth says cutting down on heel-wearing time may help. “There are a lot of complaints about foot pain after a long night of partying in heels. Our advice is to wear the heels for a short duration in case you can’t completely avoid them,” he advises.


3 FOOT PICK-ME-UPS TO TRY
Rubber ball massage



To relive foot and heel pain, place a tennis ball or a rubber ball under the foot and roll it gently. This loosens up the foot and gets rid of plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous tissue along the bottom of the foot). Roll each leg for one minute.


Thumb massage



Sit and cross one leg over the other. Using both thumbs, apply pressure along the length of your foot (underneath). Use gentle but steady pressure and work towards the toes. Repeat for the other leg.


Bottle massage
This simple trick can be done with a bottle that has been frozen in the refrigerator. Sit on a chair and place the frozen bottle underfoot. Do a back and forth rolling motion until you feel relaxed."
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Akash Wadhwa,TV,We spent the New Year’s eve with our son Sartaj in Lucknow: Aditi Sharma and Sarwar Ahuja,"Lucknow girl and actress Aditi Sharma and her hubby actor Sarwar Ahuja ushered in the New Year by spending the night with the new entrant in the family, their son Sartaj. The couple was recently blessed with a son who was delivered at a hospital in Lucknow. “This New Year Eve was really special for us since we got to spend it with out little Krishna, our Sartaj. We have always spent the New Year’s Eve with our friends in Mumbai, partying. But this time it was just the three of us and my parents, having a gala time watching this little angel in our life, who has completely changed our lives,” shared an elated Aditi, getting emotional. Adding, Sarwar said, “Sartaj is actually awake the whole night -- I mean he sleeps the whole day and he is awake the whole night till 6 am. So, we played with him the whole night.” Ask daddy Sarwar on how life has changed post fatherhood and he said, “Life has changed a lot but in a good way. Our whole life now revolves around Sartaj. Taking care of his needs, guessing why he is crying, timing the changing of diapers, every conversation now revolves around him. Another good change that I have observed personally in me over this month is that I have become more caring about my parents. I have realised that in old age, parents too become like kids and they need to be taken care of just like the babies.”
Aditi and Sarwar with their son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Although life has now become a routine for the couple looking after their son, but Aditi explains that things actually didn’t go as per the plan for the two of them as Sartaj was born three weeks before the due date. “I always used to tell Sarwar that I want you to be there by my side when the baby arrives and as per the plan he had got his tickets booked a day before the due date. But things changed at the last minute.”

“The only regret I have is that I was not there with Aditi when all this happened. I really wanted to feel the first moment when Sartaj came into this world. But three weeks before the due date, I get a call from Aditi saying that the doctor has called her to the hospital,” said Sarwar, adding, “Every minute I was getting the updates and within an hour or so I got the news that we have had a baby boy. I took a flight the same night and as luck would have it, I missed my connecting flight as it got cancelled and it was after a lot of jaddo-jehad that I managed to reach the hospital,” said Sarwar.

And while Aditi was hesitant to carry the baby in her arms, Sarwar has proved to be quite a pro. “Sarwar is actually quite good with kids though I am scared of carrying newborns. It is only when I started holding him for the mother’s feed that I became okay and a bit comfortable. The last newborn I carried in my lap was my own brother’s baby that too when I was seven years old. Woh bhi bed ke centre mein baitha ke I held him. But that was way back. Before Sartaj was born, I would ask everyone ki main itne chhote baby ko kaise pakdungi and then I would get that same reply ki sab kuchh apne aap aa jayega, don’t worry. And I used to be like ki achha...okay, let’s wait and watch,” said Aditi with a laugh.

So did the two of them wish for a boy? “Well, to be frank we just prayed for a healthy baby and were really okay with both the genders. But yes, our friends in Mumbai were really excited to guess the gender. I remember how at Aditi’s baby shower, half of our friends who thought it will be a girl, wore pink and the ones who wanted it to be a boy, wore blue and there was a tug of war between them. It was really fun to see them being so excited for the baby’s arrival. More so, because in our group of friends, we are the first ones to have a baby,” said Sarwar.

Ask them how life has changed post Sartaj’s arrival and Sarwar is quick to add, “Life has changed so much! Before we had a baby, both Aditi and I were living a nomadic life. Making plans in the night, travelling to different places, partying till the wee hours but all that will change now,” shared Sarwar, adding “We have been married for six years now and we took our time to transition into the next phase of our life – parenthood. I remember whenever Aditi used to say to me that we should plan a child, I always used to tell her that we will whenever she is ready to have one. In fact, the same reply used to be to everyone in our family who asked us about when we were planning to start a family. I was very clear on this that I wanted Aditi to be ready for motherhood as most of the changes will by default come in her life – personally and professionally. She was right now at the peak of her career.”

So was Aditi prepared for motherhood, we asked. “Yes, I was very sure. I think this was the right time for us to become parents. I was mentally prepared for the new phase of our life. Motherhood is a really beautiful feeling but one has to be ready for it. I remember getting to know I have conceived while I was shooting for my Punjabi film which will release next year. I also thankfully fulfilled all my professional commitments and now I can peacefully enjoy motherhood. Also, during the process I realised that real-life motherhood is really different from a reel one. I have played a mother and a pregnant women several times on screen. For that, I used to observe a lot of pregnant ladies but real life mein experience was completely hatt ke.”

So has she decided on how long the break from work is going to be? “Well, I haven’t planned anything as such. Let’s see since work commitment on television is really long. After a few months, I will be working towards making a comeback. But as of now, we are really excited for Sartaj’s first Lohri celebrations which will be in Hyderabad, in Sarwar’s hometown. It will be a big day for all of us,” said she."
"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Melissa D'costa,Lifestyle,Are you hungover today? Fix it with a heavy breakfast,"Welcome to the New Year, and if you are guilty of downing one too many shots the night before, chances of you waking up with a hangover are high. It can be a challenge to get through the day with a headache and not everyone is adept at battling through the nauseous state. However, it helps to pay heed to what experts have to say about it. Dietician Sheela Tanna advises you to take a dotshot the night before as that supposedly helps you wake up the next morning minus a hangover. She adds, “If you have overindulged, then you must be prepared to deal with the repercussions the morning after. A throbbing headache is just one of the fallouts, but a hearty breakfast can help you deal with some of the aftereffects. Waffles with butter and maple syrup, eggs, fruits and a combination of carbohydrates and fats are known to help combat the hangover the following morning. Also, liquids other than water should be avoided to keep that feeling of nausea at bay.” Make a note of your drinks and Don’t mix them to avoid a hangover
Limit the quantity of alcohol intake at one time. Consume it slowly instead of downing shots one after the other. Keep yourself hydrated and do not drink on an empty stomach. No matter what the temptation, avoid mixing your alcohol. Stick with beer and wine as they are the safest bets to avoid any kind of hangover provided they are consumed in moderation. Don’t mix vodka with whiskey as you will end up with a bad headache. Fruit and vegetable juices are better mixes for your drinks instead of soda because of the extra vitamins in the former. Avoid fried foods with booze, and do not mix alcohol with medication. Opt for protein and fiber rich foods with your drinks.

Make a note of this...
Avoid tequila Alcohol such as tequila and whiskey has high level of methanol and hence, high congener present in it causes a bad hangover. So, if you are looking to consume alcohol that doesn’t give a hangover, opt for vodka, gin or rum. According to mixologist Latesh Kotian a vodka/rum-based cocktail without sugar and with antioxidants, vitamin C and potassium gives a hangover-free morning after.

Antioxidants in your cocktails can help
Drinking alcohol induces oxidative stress, whose effect can be reduced by using antioxidants. The use of natural antioxidant ingredients like saffron, turmeric, beetroot reduction and mulled cucumber can help fight this oxidative stress.

Opt for fresh fruit juices to flavour your cocktails
Use fresh orange juice, lemon, pineapple, etc, which provides flavour and vitamin C, that your body needs.

Use ingredients rich in potassium
Use of potassium rich ingredients like banana, orange, cucumber, grapefruit, coconut water, etc helps in retaining water content in the body, when alcohol dehydrates the body.

Keep natural sugar at hand
Using natural or simple sugar will help reduce the hangover.

,"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Lifestyle,Why we should talk about sustainable living,"According to a CPCB estimate from 2012, India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day. This is close to the weight of 9,000 Asian elephants. Worse, a little over 10,000 tonnes a day of plastic waste remains uncollected, which eventually ends up in the natural environment - in our seas and oceans or piling up on our lands. The plastic processing industry is estimated to grow to 22 million tonnes (MT) a year by 2020 from 13.4 MT in 2015 and nearly half of this is single-use plastic, according to a Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry study.

By 2050, the amount of plastic in seas and oceans across the world will weigh more than the fishes, says an estimate by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.


Quoting Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reports, TERI states that plastic contributes to 8% of the total solid waste collected in the country. Households generate maximum plastic waste, of which water and soft drink bottles form the bulk.

77% of people in the US and Australia want to learn how to live more sustainably – the data collected showed that 93% of all surveyed indicated a general concern for the environment with plastic pollution (40.1%), biodiversity loss (39.1%), and climate change (38%) deemed the top three issues. Both the US and Australia have been dealing with these problems, with climate change notably being blamed for the record-setting wildfires in California as well as the major bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef.

"Created: Jan 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Anupam V Kapil,Lifestyle,2020: What the numbers predict for India,"Here are astro-numerologist Anupam V Kapil’s predictions for the country
Born on August 15, 1947, India is ruled by number 8 (Saturn). In its 73rd year, it will be ruled by number 9 (Mars). The country’s fate number is 6, which is ruled by Venus and its destiny number is 8. Number 6 is a peace-loving number and Number 8 is the tough karmic task master of destiny.
At the moment, India is ruled by Narendra Modi, born on 17 September 1950, with fate number 8.


As India enters its 73rd year, a solar eclipse in India’s 8th house will involve Sun, Moon and Jupiter (planet of economy) being caught between Rahu and Ketu. This brings enhanced fears and uncertainty. India will go through personal year number 9 in 2020, which indicates closing of a nine-year cycle. Many methods/laws/customs might be abrogated. Though Number 9 is a painful vibration, the Universal vibration of 2020 is 4, which will force the governments across the world to create a new roadmap, foundation and structure to work in a disciplined way. Number 4 brings substantial progress in educational and commercial affairs. But all these good things will start happening only after September, when the engineering and auto sector shall start reviving slowly. The future will be of hydrogen, not of electric sector.
The commercial truck segment shall take about two years to revive. New-age technologies discovered in 2020 and evolution of artificial intelligence will change the way businesses will be done in future.

For the purpose of numerology, life is divided in to three periods: The digit corresponding with the month controls the first 27 years. For India, this month is August or Number 8. Saturn ruled from 1947 to 1974, during which we saw wars with Pakistan, China and Bangladesh.

The second phase is governed by the birthday digit. For India, born on 15th, this digit is 6. So we had Venus ruling India for the next 27 years, from 1975 to 2002. This phase saw an increase in comforts but also wars and political assassinations due to an afflicted Venus in the 3rd house.

From 2002 onwards, we are again being run by Number 8. Also, Jupiter will move temporarily in India’s ninth house in Capricorn and retrograde between May and September this year. It will act as an exalted planet, and by aspecting the 3rd house, it will increase the expenditure on army, railways and religious institutions. Major changes in judicial framework will be seen.



A repeat of the dangerous Saturn-Pluto conjunction

A dangerous affliction of Pluto, the 10th lord of India’s Independence chart, is happening right now in India’s eighth house and will continue till mid-January 2020. Last time this happened was when there was civil unrest in Punjab. But slow planet conjunctions don’t give immediate results. Accidents and conspiracies are also foreseen when Mars crosses natal Ketu in the 7th house and meets transit Ketu and Jupiter in the 8th house in February."

"Updated: Jan 2, 2020, 18:48 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,"Go clean and green in 2020, say no to toxic beauty products","The year 2019 witnessed conversations and discussions around what we consume and how it affects the environment and what’s sustainable and what’s not. Surprisingly, these conversations were not just restricted to food and clothing, but also took over the beauty and cosmetics industry. The term ‘clean beauty’ took center stage. Here’s everything you should know about the buzzword.

What is clean beauty?


As the term suggests, clean beauty refers to products that are mindfully created and produced without any proven or suspected toxic ingredients. Most of the products curated and created are said to have been sourced ethically and do not have side effects on your skin and the environment. “It is all about using the original source in its natural form and using that to the best of its capacity,” says Rubeina Karachiwalla, a beauty entrepreneur.

Dermatologist and aesthetician Dr Anil Abraham says, “Patients have been wanting to know more about the trend and its benefits. As doctors, we are realising that it’s not a fad and is going to be the direction that skincare and health are going to take.” Deep Lalvani, a clean beauty curator, explains, “Increased exposure to pollution, stress and toxins in skincare has resulted in a more sensitive skin. Hence, this is building a stronger case towards clean beauty products.”
‘Clean beauty products are good for the environment too’


“Products impact the environment through two main components — the product itself and product packaging. Product packaging includes several components that negatively impact the environment, namely plastic. A clean beauty approach focuses on sustainable packaging, recycling and using a supply chain that reduces carbon footprint,” says Deep. “Clean and green beauty should go hand-in-hand. The consumer must take their power back by demanding clean beauty products with sustainable packaging,” he adds.


Experts advise caution as labels can be misleading


Experts advise that one should exercise caution and not follow a label that says ‘clean’. “There is a risk that these labels — natural, organic, preservative-free — may not actually be reflected in the contents of the product. It could be a clever marketing ploy to sell more expensive products to niche consumers who are aware of environmental damage,” says Dr Anil. “Some times, manufacturers use cheaper substitutes for natural materials and claim that it is clean, natural or vegan. Hence, consumers need to be informed and educate about the ingredients that are being used in products,” says Rubeina. Desiree Pereira, owner of a clean beauty line adds, “Manufacturers may use ingredients that may actually be worse than the ingredients they are trying to avoid in order to meet the ‘organic or natural’ criteria, and get similar
efficacy. I would advise people to not go by labels, especially if they are not sure about how some of them can be
misleading.”




Is clean beauty the answer to healthy-looking skin?


For those who think clean beauty is the answer to glowing skin, experts advise otherwise. “A healthy lifestyle is the best beauty care. It is best to avoid harsh treatments and products on the skin. Products need to be genuine and manufacturers should ensure that the labels are not misleading and are within the reach of the common consumer in terms of price,” sums up Dr Anil."

"Created: Jan 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Rishi spends 10 days with cops to play a police officer,"After making his debut as a gangster in Attu, Rishi Rithvik will now be donning khakhi in his next, Marijuana. The film, directed by debutant MD Anand, will be a thriller that talks about how drug addiction is leading to crimes.

Says Anand, “We generally blame parents for their children turning into monsters. This film will show how parents should be vigilant and ensure their kids don’t stray into a dangerous path. The film’s antagonist commits crimes under the influence of marijuana, and the story is about how the hero and heroine, who are both cops, nab him.”


Rishi reveals that he spent 10 days with cops to prepare for this role. “I didn’t want any shades of Attu to come into this role. One of my brothers is a police officer, so I tagged along with him for 10 days to study the body language of cops to get into this role,” elaborates the actor."

There were also the super stylish shots of Darshan and Upendra in stills from their upcoming film Roberrt and Kabza respectively — both promising loads of action and one from Dhananjaya K, who is set to also debut as a producer with his film Badava Rascal, which comes across as what one would call a realistic entertainer. While many other stars in the Kannada film industry are set to make a mark in 2020 with some interesting projects, these posters were a lovely treat to fans on day one of this new year."
"Created: Jan 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,"Mayakkum Margazhi: I usually don’t go past 5 minutes for an RTP, says Mahathi","Performing a Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP) is an essential part of most Carnatic concerts, but there’s no denying that its inclusion increases the duration of the performance. Holding the audience’s attention and making them connect with the verses are some of the challenges artistes face. That’s one of the reasons why Mahathi S has chosen to do RTPs differently this year. The singer has been choosing general topics that relate to the audience for this segment.
“Until last year, my RTPs were about God, but this year, I’ve been trying to sing on general subjects as well,” says Mahathi, “Usually in kutcheris, the songs are all about a particular God or a spiritual element. So, I decided to take up general subjects, like flowers, animals, Tamizh and Thirukkural, which Sanjay sir (Sanjay Subrahmanyan) generally does. For instance, one of my pallavis was —Kattravarai rasikka vaipathu kalaiya, rasiganai karka vaipathum kalaiye. It was in the ragam Rasali. Another one was, aanam pola vaazhkai undu, vaazhndu parka vaa, padi aadi maghizha, in ragam Shanmukhapriya. I usually don’t go beyond 25 minutes for an RTP and try to keep it energetic by choosing brisk ragams. This year, there have been a few occasions when we, as artistes, clapped for our audience from the stage because they have been attentive and sat for the entire duration. I think this kind of appreciative gestures help build relationships.”

It has been 18 years since Mahathi started performing during the Margazhi season. Reminiscing about her first concert, she says, “In 2001, I performed for Karthik Fine Arts, at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Mini Hall for an audience of 20. But long ago, when I was three-and-a-half-years old, I had once sung during the season. In that sense, my first Margazhi concert was on December 25, 1988. Though my dad is from Thiruvaiyaru, he worked in a private company in Kerala, and I spent my childhood there.”

Mahathi continues, “So, every December, he’d bring me to Chennai so that I could attend concerts. It was Mandolin Shrinivas sir’s kutcheri at Mylapore Fine Arts. I was sitting on my mother’s lap and was loudly blurting out the ragas in which he was performing. When he started Madhyamavathi, I said the concert was over. Those who were seated next to my mom were quite surprised. They insisted that I do a live demo after Shrinivas sir finished his concert. The sabha secretary, Venkatraman mama, arranged for it, and my mom coaxed me to get on the dais. Shrinivas sir and Kanyakumari amma (A Kanyakumari, violinist) were on stage, playing different ragas, and I was spelling out the ragas using a stage mic. That was such a big exposure for me.”

Coming from a family of musicians, it was but natural for Mahathi to develop a deep passion for the performing arts. “My appa (Thiruvaiyaru P Sekar) is a disciple of Balamurali sir and my mom is a flautist. My great grandfather, Pazhamaneri Swaminatha Iyer, is the fourth Sangita Kalanidhi of Madras Music Academy. Our house in Thiruvaiyaru is a stone’s throw away from Thyagaraja’s sannidhi. So, I was heavily influenced by music in my growing up years,” she says.


But why did it take her so many years to perform during Margazhi? “That’s because I was based out of Kerala, where I was doing my schooling. It was actually after I got an opportunity to sing for Ilaiyaraaja sir that I shifted to Chennai. I sang for him during my Class 11 vacation and shifted to Chennai for my next academic year. In a way, it was because of my playback singing career that I could perform during Margazhi,” she states.


But the singer admits her career in films also stopped people from taking her seriously as a classical musician. “I had big hits as a playback singer till 2011. During those few years, people thought I was taking Carnatic music lightly, even though I wasn’t. The problem is, if you appear on a TV show, people think you are more into light music. Even if you maintain your film and Carnatic music career separately, it’s difficult to change this mindset of people.”


But now that she’s established herself as a Carnatic musician as well, is there any advice that she’d like to give aspiring Carnatic musicians? “It takes a lot of preparation to sing during Margazhi. I was 17 when I gave my first Margazhi concert, and I remember how much of planning I did to finalise the ragam and kalpanaswaram. When we start, we by-heart a lot of stuff, and are not very confident about going extempore on stage. We try to render whatever we have practised to near perfection. If we forget even one swaram, then the flow completely stops. But as you evolve, you stop rehearsing. You gain confidence as you perform. The other problem that we generally face is with our voice — we don’t know how to manage our voice and get stressed out. We learn that too as we grow. But beyond all that, I think it’s also a sheer blessing to be able to perform well on stage. There are times when you have gone over a song a thousand times, but it will not work out that day. That’s the superpower controlling you.”"

"Created: Jan 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,2020 is going to be all about pop revolution and indie music: Akasa,"Akasa had a whirlwind 2019 with her songs being played at music festivals in Mauritius, the singer collaborating with international artistes like Lauv and her track Naagin becoming a chartbuster. She was recently in Bengaluru for a performance. In a quick chat with us, Akasa spoke about her work with Ricky Martin, how Thug Ranjha propelled her into the music industry, how she believes in being authentic and more, Excerpts:
So, 2019 turned out to be a rewarding year for you. Tell us more…
It was a great year. In fact, the last few months of 2019 were more eventful for me than ever. Thug Ranjha was a really good start to my career, then there was a brief gap before my next project. Meanwhile, I had also been dubbing for film songs, but two of the songs that I sang last November were included in films only recently. But, overall, yes it has been an eventful year for me.


How did the collaborations unfold? Ricky and I are managed by the same music label. The team behind the label told me that he was looking for an Indian voice for his track, Vente Pa Ca, and they asked if I would like to go for it. So, I just dubbed the scratch vocals and sent it across, and the next thing I know is that I was in the song. Even my latest track, Dil Naa Janeya, was scratch vocals. But I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the final track recently. In my head, I was only hoping for it to work out well. But it not only worked out, it also had someone like Lauv being part of it.

You have also been part of many reality shows. How do you think such platforms help artistes like you?
I don’t think reality shows help everybody, because, right now, there are so many of them. But it definitely helped me. It gave me a push and that is how I bagged the song, Tu Kheech Meri Photo. Even though, I was only a small part of it, it gave me an identity. It was the only thing I had to my credit for a long time. Reality shows give you a platform to reach out to a wider audience. But only a few lucky ones go viral. It’s a platform that prepares you for what you will experience once you enter the industry.

There’s a lot of competition among singers in the industry. How do you ensure that you stand out from the rest?
Being versatile and doing things that others probably struggle to do helps. I have worked really hard on my dancing skills and my fitness, which, in turn, helped me be the face of Thug Ranjha, and not just the voice behind it. I saw my father, Arvinder Singh, on stage and the kind of fan following he had, and I wanted the same. The ‘popstar’ aura that Beyoncé has created around herself is a true inspiration. Being authentic helps you stand out from the rest.

A lot of remixes and singles that released in 2019 were received well by the audience. Do you think 2020 will be all about indie artistes and their music?

Absolutely. I feel the ’90s were cool, because pop music was above Bollywood at that time. If you compare KK or Lucky Ali’s fan following at that time, it was way more than that of a playback singer. Thankfully, it’s making a comeback. Everyone is receiving singles very well, so much so that many tracks are now being used in films as well. I feel the pop revolution is here, and 2020 will be all about indie music.


You are a trained classical singer, but your singing style has Western influences. Tell us more about it...

I’m one of the least trained singers in my family. As a child, I was taught the basics of classical music. But since my father is a singer, I think I’ve got his genes and I’m making use if that to the fullest. Learning classical music helps you so much. If you learn the base of classical music, your voice gets so well rounded that you can sing anything. My brother is a good example of that. Woh English gaane sun sun ke shayad mujhe gaana nahi aata.


Now, who would you like to collaborate with next?

I’m at a point now where I would love to work with anyone and everyone. So far, I’ve dubbed for many music composers, but there’s no one who I don’t want to work with. Collaborating with AR Rahman, however, would be a dream come true. I have also been obsessed with Diljit Dosanj and hope that I would get to work with him too in the near future."

The actor-filmmaker will be directing Iravin Nizhal, which will be a single-shot film. “There have been a few single-shot films made across the world, like Victoria and Russian Ark, but this will be a full-fledged feature film, which will be filmed in a single shot,” says Parthiban.

The first-look poster of the film was released yesterday by Bharathirajaa. “I’d written Oththa Seruppu 15 years ago, and Iravin Nizhal five years ago. I’d almost gone on floor with this one a few years ago, but had to put the idea on the backburner because of some issues. But now, I’m starting work on this with renewed vigour because of the love people of Tamil Nadu have given me. They made my Oththa Seruppu a success and that has given me confidence,” says Parthiban.


The director has started the pre-production work. “There will be multiple characters, and we are working towards finalising the cast and crew. Alfred Hitchcock had made a film called Rope, which people acknowledge as a single-shot film. But he had shot the film by brilliantly blending to make it look like one. But we won’t be joining or stitching together scenes at all. It will be a challenge to shoot a full-length film in a single shot, and we will rehearse it before shooting. It’s a challenge I’m game for,” he signs off."
"Created: Jan 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,"My Favourite Raga: One raga I have circled back to often is Begada, says Rithvik Raja","As musicians, we learn new compositions and we keep exploring different ragas. There are different periods during which we lean towards one raga. In 10 concerts, a raga might be featured five or six times invariably. Then, once that phase passes, you probably will not hear it in the next 15 or 20 concerts. And then, it will pop back. That, I think, is the beauty of the options that are available wide and plenty. All of them have amazing scope for exploration.

One raga I have circled back to often is Begada. In fact, when I was around 12 years old, I remember telling my friends that one thing I wanted to probably learn was every composition in Begada. That raga continues to fascinate me. Incidentally, in my concert this Monday, that was the raga I sang as the main piece.


If someone put a gun to my head and said I had to pick one raga, it would be Begada. The melody of this raga is stuck in my head. I remember hanging around my mother’s classes with her teacher as a toddler. Her teacher made her learn one line in this raga over and over again across three or four classes. That was the one line I kept hearing. She was also my teacher between 2000 and 2003. The first ever composition that she taught me was the Begada varnam. That is my earliest memory of any raga or any class."
,"Created: Jan 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",Entertainment,Tovino to play a triple role in a multi-genre film,"If 2019 was about Tovino Thomas proving he can handle any role with ease, 2020 seems to be about him showing that he belongs in the big league. The actor, who is currently busy with the superhero film Minnal Murali, has signed another big-budget entertainer titled Ajayante Randam Moshanam that will have him in a triple role.

The movie’s director Jithin Lal, who has worked as the chief associate director of films such as Godha, Kalki and Ennu Ninte Moideen, tells us, “The movie has portions set in 1900, 1950 and 1990. Tovino plays characters named Maniyan, Kunjikelu and Ajayan, respectively, in these three generations. The main storyline though will be set in the 90s.”


Ask him if it’s an adventure-fantasy and Jithin says, “It has multiple genres. But at its core, it’s an entertainer. The movie would remind the audience of the stories that they have read in Malayalam comic magazines.”

Jithin, who had recently helmed a trilingual music video titled Pragathi featuring Wamiqa Gabbi, Lena and Nyla Usha, also informs us that the work on the script and its pre-production has been on for two years now. Sujith Nambiar has penned the screenplay while Dhibu Ninan Thomas, who composed for the Tamil movie Kanaa, will handle the music department.

“We are now in the process of finalising the cast. As it’s a big project, there is some more work to be done before we can start shooting. We expect the movie to go on floors by mid 2020,” says the filmmaker.


The team has zeroed in on Kannur, Kasaragod and Wayanad as the main locations for Ajayante Randam Moshanam. Like Tovino-Basil Joseph team’s Minnal Murali, this film too is set to be dubbed and released in several languages apart from Malayalam."

The club members and their guests turned up in hordes to enjoy the night. “This is a very special New Year’s Eve for Tolly Club. It is the curtain-raiser for the celebration of the club’s 125 years,” said Anil Mukerji, CEO and managing member of the club.


The party had an enviable lineup of artistes like Louis Banks, Shayne Hyrapiet, Michelle and Sonia Teresa Saigal, who enthralled the crowd with their amazing performances. As the clock struck 12, everyone thronged the dance floor and wished each other a very happy New Year. We spotted percussionist Bickram Ghosh with wife Jaya Seal Ghosh at the do. Bickram told us, “It’s always lovely to be present at the club’s New Year’s Eve bash. Jaya, our elder son, Adit, and I are having a super time. The music is great. Louis Banks and his team are simply phenomenal. I am ringing in the New Year in a relaxed manner with my family.”


The celebrations rounded off with everyone digging into a lavish spread of Indian and continental dishes."

Exclusive film stills and posters of some of the most-awaited films of the year made their debut and offered the glimpse of what they year would look like. While Puneeth Rajkumar-starrer Yuvarathnaa made quite the impact with its quirky stills where the star is seen posing along with skeletons, Ganesh, Diganth and Pavan Kumar promise a fun-filled outing with Gaalipata 2. There were also the super stylish shots of Darshan and Upendra in stills from their upcoming film Roberrt and Kabza respectively — both promising loads of action and one from Dhananjaya K, who is set to also debut as a producer with his film Badava Rascal, which comes across as what one would call a realistic entertainer. While many other stars in the Kannada film industry are set to make a mark in 2020 with some interesting projects, these posters were a lovely treat to fans on day one of this new year."

On-again, off-again relationships

Erica Fernandes and Parth Samthaan

Ever since they started working together in 'Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2', Erica Fernandes and Parth Samthaan have been linked. While the two maintain that they are just good friends, sources confirm that they are a couple. Apparently, a few months ago, the relationship hit a rough patch, and the two even started avoiding each other except when they were shooting. But the latest we hear is that Erica and Parth have resolved their differences, and are together again.


Raj Singh Arora and Pooja Gor

The two have been together for nine years now, but with their share of ups and downs. There have been rumours of them breaking up a couple of times in recent years, the most serious one being in September last year. But separation seems to be really tough for these two, as we hear that they are back together again. So, is it just as ‘good friends’ this time around?


Vishal Aditya Singh and Madhurima Tuli

These exes fought bitterly on Nach Baliye last year, but it looks like they have kissed and made up, literally, on Bigg Boss. So, will their new-found affection for each other last, or is it just for the show?"
"Updated: Jan 3, 2020, 15:28 IST",Deepa Soman,Entertainment,"Darshana Rajendran: In the past decade, it has become easier for actors to get opportunities","It’s been six years since Darshana Rajendran debuted as a film actor. In this period, she has played quite a few memorable characters, especially in films like Virus and Mayaanadhi. But the best is yet to come for her as she has been cast as the lead in the upcoming films Hridayam by Vineeth Sreenivasan and the anthology film Pennum Cherukkanum by Aashiq Abu. She is also part of Rajeev Ravi’s Thuramukham. Darshana tells us what it has been like to work in an industry, in which the former finance professional ended up by chance.

You seem to be bagging quite a few plum projects, of late.


Yes. There is Pennum Cherukkanum and Thuramukham, which I am done shooting for. And then there is Hridayam that is set to begin soon. All of these are very exciting projects.

Pennum Cherukkanum is your third movie with Aashiq Abu. What’s it like to work with him?

It does feel like home for me. From the moment I got a call from him about this film, I have been waiting for the shoot to begin. I think there is something amazing with work that comes out of a very comfortable, happy environment. Aashiq Abu is a master at that.
You are working again with actor Roshan Mathew, who has now debuted in Bollywood, through Pennum Cherukkanum. Please tell us about the experience.

Although A Very Normal Family, a play which he directed was our first work together, we have both been very closely associated with each other in the theatre space. We have also started working on our next play. We worked on Koode, but we didn’t have many scenes together. So Pennum Cherukkanum felt new. I have a huge list of directors, actors and artistes I want to work with in films... I think all actors do. With Pennum Cherukkanum, I got to tick Roshan off that list. He is a very intelligent, giving actor and there is a lot to learn from him. It was great working with him and I hope we get to do more work together.


You are someone who started in the industry playing character roles. What’s it like to be cast as a central character?

I come from theatre where sometimes I am on stage for only a five-minute scene and otherwise throughout the play. How big my part has hardly mattered. With films as well, it has not been so much about screen time, as it is about what I am doing with that time. Having said that, a lot of writing in films is hero-heroine centred and it is not very often that we come by good character roles. So, in a space like that, it does feel great to be considered for more prominent roles. It is also great to be part of an industry that does not have set rules when it comes to how the lead characters should look.

In an interview a few months ago, actress Parvathi Thiruvoth said that when she turns director, she would like to work with you and Asif Ali…
She did. And I was very happy to hear that. But of course, it is not on the cards. She was just answering a hypothetical question (laughs) It will be great if it happens though.


You were a finance professional before you accidentally chanced upon theatre, while in Chennai a few years ago. How has the transition to an actress been like?
I did not see it coming when I was working in finance. But, finding theatre really did change my life. It was very liberating to find something that I enjoyed so much. It started as a hobby that I did alongside my job. But slowly I wanted to spend more and more time with it. Deciding to quit my job was the most difficult decision for sure, but one that I am very glad I took. It has been far from easy. There is no end of the month salary, no routine, no certainty. It was very different from the life I lived before and took some time getting used to. But now it is part of the deal. One stage bow or one good day at shoot seems to make up for the ‘not so nice’ parts of the job.


And theatre happened to you apparently because you used to sing. Any explorations on that front?
Yes. I went in for a musical audition thinking I could sing and ended up doing a lot more than just singing. That is how theatre happened. I love singing, but to be honest I do not think of myself as a singer. It has always been quite a personal thing for me until Bawra Mann of Mayaanadhi happened. I am still scared to put out more of my work. But I would love to. I did explore the space a little more and there have been some exciting developments. I hope to do a lot more but slowly.


You are an artiste who stepped into the industry with no godfather, slowly revealing your calibre. Please tell us about that process.

It has been difficult for sure but honestly I think actors have it a lot easier than before. There is a lot more access now. Most of the films hold auditions today. I am able to reach the directors I would like to work with. That is a great thing for an actor. Even getting to audition for films like Thuramukham is so fulfilling.


Having said that, it has been far from easy to figure out this world on my own. Whether it is going for an audition or picking a particular film or deciding to do a particular character or just agreeing on my payment, I think I am still doing some trial and error and learning along the way.


Tell us about the workshops you conduct for children.

This is another area of interest. I absolutely love working with children. I do storytelling sessions for children. Sometimes I work with childrens’ publications and take their stories to kids. With all this technology and easy access, I feel like we are slowly losing the habit of telling stories to children. But there is some magic that storytelling can create for them and I am very happy that I get to do that. Apart from storytelling, I also conduct theatre workshops for children along with my sister Bhavana. We recently started ‘Theatre with B and D’ to introduce children to theatre and we have done workshops in Bangalore and Kochi."
"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,"My First Shot: Your first film always sets the tone for your career, says Andrea","I initially did not want to be an actor because I wanted to pursue music. So, I was saying no to all the film offers that were coming my way, including Pachaikili Muthucharam. But one of Gautham Menon’s assistants knew me from my theatre days.

She said, ‘Listen, I know you are going to study music. But do this for pocket money and go’. So, I said OK. But I had no idea what I was getting into. I landed up on the set to shoot. This makeup artiste applied makeup on my face and even at that point, I did not know what was going on. Luckily, I had a good DOP (cinematographer), Mr Aravind Krishna.



My first shot for Pachaikili Muthucharam was the opening shot of the song, Un Sirippinil, where my character stands at the doorway. So, I gave my first shot and Mr AK was like, ‘Come here, who put this makeup on your face? Go wash your face’ (laughs). He did not want any makeup on me. So I washed my face and gave the shot again. I did not wear any makeup for the entire film! I was, like, 21 at the time. Much later, Gautham told me that a lot of female fans really liked how I was looking real on screen in that film. I guess I have to thank Mr Aravind Krishna for that. Your first film always sets the tone and foundation for your career. I was very lucky that way to have worked with such wonderful people."
"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,Nothing can stop people from going to movie halls; that’s the magic of cinema,"It’s been more than a month since ace lensman-turned-filmmaker PC Sreeram was honoured with the Legend of Indian Cinema award at the International Film Festival of India, Goa. The veteran cinematographer wrote, “miles to go to capture many dreams”, expressing his gratitude on social media. “I really meant it. Awards mean a lot, but recognitions shouldn’t disturb one’s workflow,” he begins. In a free-wheeling chat with us, Sreeram talks about the unexpected honour, his plans to get into film direction, a dream that he has been nurturing for quite some time, the growth of south film industry in the recent years, and the dismal response to some of his recent films at the Box Office...
How do you look at this honour?
I was told about the award by the festival director when I was shooting in Hyderabad. It was completely unexpected and initially, I didn’t understand what it was for. Later, they explained it to me and I was happy to receive it. For me, this is one more award — to work hard for more films.

You have a Hindi and Telugu project in the pipeline. The former will see you teaming up with Balki again. How is it to work repeatedly with a few people?
I have always felt that there are some directors who know how to get the best out of me. That’s the reason why I tend to team up with some people repeatedly. Moreover, you have that comfort level with a few people. In fact, there is no point in working on a project together without having a complementing vibe. The project with Balki was supposed to start earlier, but he became busy with Mission Mangal’s script and it took him more time than expected to complete it.
You couldn’t be part of Super Deluxe and Psycho, two films which initially had your name in it...
The shooting of Super Deluxe had started long ago, and it got affected by demonetisation, because of which the production was halted for some time. So, my dates clashed with Padman. I had watched the movie (Super Deluxe) and I liked it, but it deserved more attention from the audiences. I chose not to do Psycho because I had a serious allergic problem and I didn’t know about its intensity initially. I needed a few months’ break, and hence, I asked Mysskin to go ahead with my assistant. I also missed taking up Vikram Kumar’s Telugu movie with Nani.

A Malayalam (Praana) and Telugu (Naa Nuvve) film which you worked on recently didn’t live up to the expectations. What do you think?
I expected Naa Nuvve to be at least an above-average grosser at the box office, but it was rejected outrightly. I felt it had its basics right. But sometimes, you can’t gauge the audience’s mindset. I personally enjoyed working on Praana, which had only one character. Speaking of that film, I’m reminded of Parthiban’s Oththa Seruppu. He had done an extraordinary job of holding the audience’s attention.

There’s so much discussion about regional cinema coming up with superior content in the decade that went by. What’s your opinion?
When I was working recently in Hyderabad, I was having a discussion with a few people there. They said, of late, the market for big-ticket Hindi films has gone down in the south. Bollywood had a good market in Karnataka and the Telugu-speaking states. They say that there used to be a festival mood earlier when big Bollywood flicks released there. I watched a much-hyped Hindi film some time ago — it had great VFX work, but lacked a screenplay. What is the point of having good VFX work without an engaging narration? But content-oriented Hindi movies have been performing well here, like Badhaai Ho, Andhadhun, Article 15, and so on.


There is a debate on the threat posed by OTT platforms to cinema. What do you think of this?
It is more or less similar to what happened with satellite television in the 90s. Many movie halls used to have empty evening and night shows when satellite television became popular. But that didn’t stop people from going to movie halls — that’s the magic of cinema. When I was working on Padman in a remote village in Madhya Pradesh, I came across people who did not have money for their basic needs. But I learnt that two out of the four theatres there had houseful shows. I think OTT content will become monotonous sooner or later. I read somewhere that two such platforms have already withdrawn from India. The problem is, here, when someone comes up with something, 20 other people also jump in and eventually, it loses steam. Also, from what I have seen, I don’t think so many series with grey characters and gory scenes can impress people for a long time. Regional content has got its own strength and the audience will flock to theatres if they are given engaging movies.


Is there any Tamil film which impressed you in recent times?
One movie which impressed me with its screenplay and making was Lokesh’s Kaithi. It had a slickness to it and the element of time was intriguingly worked in the narration. I was amazed to see how it was packaged commercially, with nicely choreographed fights. I would say the film is on par with world cinema. It was after a long time that I got totally engrossed in a film.


You seem to be nurturing plans to direct a film. Can we expect something soon?
I will surely direct not one, but many films. I have more frames to capture. I haven’t decided what kind of projects I want to be at the helm of, though.


You voice your opinion on social causes often through Twitter. Do you think all celebrities should do it?
I believe everyone should voice their opinion. I can’t hold back my opinions for sure. I express them loud, but I make sure I don’t hurt anybody. But I will stand by what I express on social media. It’s the biggest weapon we have now to raise our voice."
"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,"Pet-Time Stories: Frankie is everything to me, says Athulya Ravi","When Athulya Ravi lost her first dog, Rosy, in an accident, the actress decided that she would never have pets at home. “Her death affected me deeply. I was young and I could never come to terms with it. I remember crying for days together. I told my parents that we shouldn’t have dogs at home. Of course, we had several dogs in our farm in Coimbatore. I was close to them, but I didn’t get too attached. It’s only after moving to Chennai that I finally decided to have one,” says Athulya, petting her Shih Tzu Frankie, while talking to us...
‘Frankie keeps me stress-free’
Athulya says that Frankie helps her destress. “When I decided to have pets, I wanted to have a Shih Tzu; I have a special liking towards that breed. I happened to see a video of Frankie when he was a baby. The moment I saw him, I decided to bring him home. He was 34 days old when I got him home. It is a delight to watch him grow,” she says, “He is my alarm clock... he waits patiently for me to wake up in the mornings. If I’m not up and about by 10am, he pushes the door open and tries to wake me up. If I had a late-night shoot, I’d sleep for some more time. So, if I don’t wake up, he usually sleeps next to my bed.” The actress goes on to add, “Our job can be stressful at times, but Frankie keeps me stress-free. The joy he brings to my heart when I see him waiting for me at the door is indescribable. He figures out I’m home the minute he hears the lift door opening. He waits near the door and once he sees me, he jumps on me. And at that instant, I forget all my other worries. Frankie means everything to me. He is like family to all of us. My mother never addresses him as naai; she calls him chellam or kuttyma. My brother jokes about how she calls him naaiye instead!”


‘He is my defender’
Athulya says Frankie knows when she’s upset. “When somebody at home is angry or is shouting at me, Frankie plays the role of my defender,” says Athulya, “He barks at them until they stop. We have noticed this a couple of times. Sometimes, my mother and I pretend that we are arguing about something. But he is very intelligent and knows that we are putting up an act. Whenever I am really down, he jumps on me and asks me to pet him. Naturally, it brightens my mood. He is a darling that way.”

So, does he recognise her when she appears on television? “When I’m home, and if my face appears on TV, he gets confused. He looks at me and then stares at the television. It’s so funny to watch him then! But yes, he does recognise my voice and responds to me when I am talking to him over the phone. He’s first on my priority list. Like, if I am in a supermarket, I first look out for toys and food for him, and only then shop for myself and others,” says Athulya.



Play dates for Frankie
Athulya recalls how she and Yashika Aannand decided to get their pets together for a play date. “She came home with her pet, Coco, who is also a Shih Tzu. Frankie and Coco were initially acting shy around each other and didn’t play much. But after a while, they began barking and were speaking in a language only they could understand,” she says with a laugh.

Frankie and his Coimbatore tales...
Athulya regularly travels to Coimbatore with Frankie. “We take him in our car so that the journey is comfortable for him. He loves long drives. He gets all jumpy when he is in the car. He loves to put his head out of the window and get fresh air. If we close the window, he gets upset. He feels at home in Coimbatore. He walks and runs around our home like he’s the boss. I sometimes leave him behind with my family there because he loves the weather and all the attention that he gets. I travel to Coimbatore again after a few weeks to bring him back to Chennai,” she says.




Treat your pet like a family member
“If you want to have a pet, you need to promise yourself that you will spend ample time with them. Treat them like your family member. If you can’t look after them, don’t have them. It is important to spend time, talk and play with your pet. I regularly walk Frankie in the evenings. If I am busy, I make sure someone else takes him for a walk. I also ensure that I take him to the doctor for regular check-ups. This is something I don’t compromise on as I want to be with him whenever he is sick. We also ensure that we play with him every single day,” says Athulya."
"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Ishan and Ashika play rock stars in Raymo,"Pavan Wadeyarr’s upcoming movie Raymo, which stars Ishan CV and Ashika Ranganath, is a musical love story. Both the lead actors in the film are featured as musicians, who are part of a band. The team recently shot the concert and tour sequences in South Africa, while plans are afoot to shoot in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia as well. In the film, Ishan portrays a typical rock star, who plays the double-neck guitar. Stressing on how Ishan took extra classes to learn the guitar, Pavans says, “He has undergone special training to understand the nuances of playing the musical instrument. Double-neck guitars are really tough to learn. One needs to be musically inclined to play them with dexterity. We have specialists from the field coming in and training Ishan for two months. He has worked hard to ensure that he plays it onscreen with confidence.”

“Ashika, on the other hand, essays the role of a girl from an orthodox Brahmin family. The storyline focuses on the what happens when two such contrasting characters come together as part of a band,” explains the filmmaker.

The movie was shot in South Africa in December. Not many people know that there are many Kannadigas in that country, says Pavan, adding, “The nation is home to more than 20 lakh Indians, so it made all the more sense for us to shoot one of our concert sequences there. The gigs take the band across the globe, and so we’ll be travelling to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore next.”


Madhoo joins the cast…

Pavan reveals that Roja-fame actress, Madhoo, will be joining the cast of Raymo soon. “She plays a doctor, which is a pivotal role in the film. And we are delighted to have her onboard,” he adds."
"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 00:01 IST",Harshada Rege,Entertainment,The lob is here to stay,"The long bob — better known as the lob — is a hair trend that has caught the attention of women around the globe. While Bollywood actresses have often experimented with the clothes they wear, the same isn’t true when it comes to their hairstyles. However, that seems to have changed with the lob finding a fanbase among the leading ladies in B-Town. Deepika Padukone made a splash when she recently did away with her trademark long locks and instead sported a smart lob at a red carpet do. The same holds true for Kareena Kapoor Khan. Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who has always kept her mane on the shorter side, seems to be having a lot of fun styling her lob in different ways. From soft curls and waves to keeping them poker straight, she has done it all. Anushka Sharma, Bhumi Pednekar, Yami Gautam and Parineeti Chopra are among the other actresses, who are currently sporting the lob. On foreign shores, where the trend first caught on, celebs like Gal Gadot, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, Hilary Duff and Millie Bobby Brown have been rocking it. Here’s what makes this hairstyle popular...



Age no bar Women across age groups are opting for the lob. Hair expert Dorris Godambe says, “The lob doesn’t have any limitation when it comes to age; anyone can slay this look. It all depends on a person’s face structure and confidence level.” Hair expert Coleen Khan Affonso adds, “It suits women of all age groups. In fact, I think that those who are 25 years and above can have more fun with it.”





Not just a fad
Stylists say that this hairstyle is not a short-term trend. “Lob will be around for a long time as it has a youthful appeal,” points out Dorris. Talking about its longevity, Coleen says, “It has a very international vibe to it. The good thing about the lob is that it’s not too short or long. It flatters almost every hair texture and face structure. I see it staying around well into this year.”



Desi attire versus western outfits
Coleen says, “I think that it looks better with Western outfits, but you can tie a low bun when you are wearing Indian attire. It’s possible to do that as your hair is longer in the front and goes all the way back. You can add a hairpiece and do a lot more, too. Also, today everything is so fluid; women with the shortest haircuts look stunning in saris. So, there are no hard and fast rules.”



Who is sporting it the best?
Dorris lists Deepika and Anushka as her favourites. “They carry it beautifully and with a lot of confidence,” she says. Coleen, whose vote goes to Deepika, shares, “She has got the height, the face… she has what it takes to take this look to the next level.”




It’s versatile and low-maintenance

“You can do a lot with this particular style. You can put it up, or let it loose, or style it in many other ways. I am glad that our actresses are being more adventurous and doing fun stuff with their hair,” says Coleen. Talking about the versatility of the hairdo, she adds, “You can adjust it, obviously. You can texturise it, or change the parting. You can also add layers to it and make it like a messy lob, or have beach waves, or go very sleek.” Another factor that works in favour of this look is that one doesn't have to visit the parlour too often. “Unlike looks like the pixie cut, you don’t have to go for a trim at short intervals. You can let it grow out, as it doesn’t look awkward or out of shape at any stage,” points out Coleen."

Pandya shares, “We haven’t decided on that yet, but I am sure that it will be decided soon.” A close friend of Hardik, who did not wish to be named, shared, “I had been invited for the engagement but could not attend it, since it was in Dubai and I was busy with some work. It was a sudden development, and I was informed just about a week back. They have no immediate plans of tying the knot, and it might happen later in the year or even next year.”"

"Updated: Jan 3, 2020, 13:26 IST",Renuka Vyavahare,Entertainment,"KL Rahul and Athiya Shetty are in a relationship, confirm sources","Romance is in the air. After months of are they, aren’t they, KL Rahul seems to be slowly making his relationship with actress Athiya Shetty, official. Those following his feed on Instagram may have noticed his fun post with his ladylove, which also paid tribute to her dad Suniel Shetty’s film, Hera Pheri.

The news might not come as a surprise to those close to the couple, as the two have been friends for almost two years now, and most of them saw it coming, given their compatibility. The duo, along with their friends, had also gone to Thailand to bring in the New Year. Interestingly, in the beginning, many wondered if Rahul was dating Athiya’s friend Akansha Ranjan. It was also believed that she played Cupid and got the two together. Turns out, it’s neither. A friend close to the couple revealed, “Akansha and Rahul are best friends. She didn’t set him up with Athiya.” Talking about Rahul and Athiya’s equation, the source adds, “They have been friends for a long time. Both have a crazy sense of humour and most of their buddies had anticipated their friendship transforming into romance. The two have been dating for a few months now. Given their schedules, they try to spend as much time with each other as possible.”


We hear, Athiya’s family — dad Suniel, mom Mana and brother Ahan — are extremely fond of Rahul, and are supportive of her dashing cricketer beau.

Their comments on his posts are testament to the rapport they share. In July last year, BT had reported about Athiya and Rahul being in a relationship, but the two had kept mum back then. In fact, the last time (August 19, 2019) we asked Rahul about his relationship status, he told BT, “I have learnt to keep my personal life personal and not make it a thing to talk about. I am committed to cricket right now.” However, he didn’t pretend to be single either. When asked he if was single, he had replied, “I don’t really know. When I figure that out, I will give you a call and tell you.”

Rahul, now that the news is confirmed, we are waiting for that call."

"Created: Jan 3, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,Lifestyle,"Reduce, reuse, recycle: Start 2020 with sustainable fashion","From decluttering your wardrobe and being more informed about a brand’s ethical practices to shopping for vintage clothing and donating your unwanted clothes, here are some tips to adopt this lifestyle change
Eco-friendly fabric’, ‘slow fashion’, ‘organic’ or ‘sustainable’ – chances are that you came across these words almost every time you read about fashion forecasts and trends for 2020. But if you still aren’t thinking about what will happen to your worn-out tees, denims, handbags or sneakers once you have discarded them, you are far from choosing sustainable fashion as a lifestyle. Following sustainable fashion is mostly about making informed choices, and all it takes to begin is a closer look at your wardrobe. Reduce, reuse and recycle should be your goal for this year, and decluttering your wardrobe is the first step towards that goal. Thinking twice (or even thrice) before buying anything, assessing if you actually need what you want, donating and/or swapping clothes and upcycling are a few simple changes that you can incorporate in your lifestyle to contribute your bit towards sustainability.


Part ways with your 'never worn' clothes before you shop When was the last time you took a note of the clothes that have been lying around in your wardrobe that you no longer wear? If it has been a while, then assess your wardrobe to see whether you really need anything new the next time you want to buy something or check out the latest sale. A quick tip for those who have piles of clothes to go through – “Sort your wardrobe keeping in mind the ‘most worn’, ‘rarely worn’ and ‘never worn’ clothes. The easiest way to clean your closet is to part ways with ‘never worn’ clothes first. Donate them to NGOs or organisations that recycle clothes,” suggests Sujata Chatterjee, a fashion innovator, who has been promoting sustainable fashion and living. Though it’s easier to believe that “one never has enough clothes to wear”, it’s time to be honest with yourself and tell yourself that you need not buy new clothes for every occasion. “If you are honest with yourself, you will realise that all those dresses that you have been hoarding thinking kabhi toh kaam aayega are actually of no use. Just give them away to those who need them,” says Gurgaon-based architect Kanika Kush, who cleared 70% of her wardrobe in just a few days when she decided to embrace slow fashion last year.


Borrowing or renting clothes is not bad
Most of you may have heard from your mothers about how they used to exchange clothes within the family on special occasions, rather than buy new outfits every time. Decluttering your closet is important, and once you have done that, be mindful of the fact that you do not accumulate more than what you need. “Every time I have an urge to buy something new, I ask myself, ‘Do I really need it?’ and ‘Do I need it for just one occasion or for multiple times?’. If I feel that I really need something, but just for one occasion, I am happy borrowing it,” says Deepa Choudhary, a Delhi-based entrepreneur, who started looking for sustainable ways in fashion almost three years ago.



Shop from eco-conscious brands
Before buying something, check out outlets that offer second-hand clothes or resale sites. Do not resort to buying from high street fashion labels as your first choice. This will not just save you money, but also help you say no to fast fashion. “I stopped buying from high street retail outlets a year ago. It was a conscious decision, keeping in mind how much wastage these fast fashion brands promote. One can also research the brands they are buying from, and spend money only on those following ethical practices, or buy from retail outlets when they have offers like swapping old clothes,” says Kritika Batra, a Delhi-based software engineer. Another option can be buying your own fabrics and getting them stitched, she adds.


Reuse and upcycle

If you don’t like giving away your clothes, look for ways to reuse them. There are several videos online on how to convert your ripped denims into a cool bag, or how to use your old tee even if it’s faded. “Reuse your old clothes, mend them, or convert them into a new attire. Initially, it might sound tedious, but once you start doing it, you will notice how you end up buying less,” says Gurgaon-based entrepreneur Sakshi Arora, adding, “Do not buy as per trends. In fact, it would be wise to copy the style and recreate it from something that you already own.”


Tips to keep in mind while shopping

Do not buy something just because it is cheap

Look out for brands where you can exchange your old clothes

Research for brands those follow ethical practices

Opt for organic fabrics

Make a list of what you need to buy, and stick to it"

"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,Veda Krishnamurthy: 2020 is exciting for women's cricket,"She’s an intrinsic part of the batting line-up for the Indian women’s cricket team. Bengaluru-based Veda Krishnamurthy has become the pin-up girl for many aspirants in Karnataka and India. She is excited about the upcoming 2020 T20 World Cup in Australia, where she says, “We have a lot to live up to, as the Indian women’s cricket team has announced that we are in it for the big haul.” Excerpts… How does 2020 look for women’s cricket in general and you in particular?
2020 looks very exciting for women’s cricket. We have the Women’s T20 World Cup coming up this year, followed by the 50-over World Cup that will be held early next year. It is going to be a very busy and exciting year for us. There is a lot at stake, not just for those playing cricket and in the team, but for those who are vying for a spot to play for the nation.
As for me, I have ended the last year well, so I hope I carry forward the same form. Since the World Cup is very close, I hope to continue all that I’ve been doing for the past three-four months. We’ve got a core group with members who have been playing together for a while. I am hoping that everything works for us.

What is going to be India’s biggest strength at the 2020 World Cup?
That’s a tough question. I think our biggest strength are our spinners, they are superior compared to the teams across the world. Our spinners bowl most of the 20 overs, so if our spinners get it right, it will work the most in our favour. Given the fire power that we have in our batting, a good show by the spinners can help boost and complement that. The camaraderie within the team is very important to keep the rhythm and chemistry of a batting line-up going. How do you girls bond when not playing?
If you see our social media accounts, especially Instagram, there is a lot of banter that goes on between us. We are always active, we all tend to comment when someone posts something new, which actually shows the bond we share. We are basically a bunch of youngsters, so there is so much energy off the field as well. For instance, if one starts to dance, the other 14 join in. If one sings, the other 14 do so too. We do almost everything together, it is natural and organic. In fact, I feel our bond off the field reflects on the field too. This is important for those who are part of a team, and this team shares that kind of bond.
Which is the team that our team is watching out for?
Any day, it is Australia hands down. They have been so dominating in the past few years and they are the defending champions playing in their home conditions. They are going to be our biggest competition. But, since it is T20, it is also about who clicks on that day. It depends on the performance on that particular day.

Is there anything you feel is required or not in place yet to give women’s cricket that extra push?

The ICC has done a good job of spacing out various events. We saw that with the 2017 World Cup as well. There was a lot of publicity. There were many hoardings and ads during the men’s Champions Trophy, which brought in awareness about the event. There was a lot of talk about women’s cricket too, there was a lot of crowd and a lot of people watched it even back home in India.

Now, since the next World Cup is happening in Australia, which is also a country where people love their sport, there is a lot of thought that is going into the planning of these events. Incidentally, our final match coincides with International Women’s Day. The BCCI is making sure all our games are televised, including those played at the domestic levels. They are putting a lot of effort to get the domestic scene right. Now, people are aware of the women’s cricket team and the fixtures. If one compares the 2017 World Cup to the upcoming T20 World Cup, people are aware that the match is happening in Australia. Awareness is half the battle won.

You have met upcoming players who are part of Karnataka’s women’s cricket team. What is the potential you see there?

We’ve got a very good bunch of youngsters. Karnataka has one of the few associations that train children right from the time they are about 10-11 years of age. They are trained to be a part of the under-16 games. There are a lot of youngsters to watch out for. At the same time, it is about them doing well in their age group, and continuing to perform well at the next level. That is the kind of potential selectors look for — they see who has the potential to perform well in the next level.

Off field appearances have been taking up a lot of your free time. Do you find it challenging to put in an effort towards styling yourself?

I’m getting better at that. Though, even today, if I am hanging out with my friends, you will find me in my joggers, t-shirt and chappals. But over time, I am also becoming more aware of what suits me in terms of outfits, hair and makeup. I am learning."

Is Amala Paul planning a business?
Sources close to the actress say that she really wants to start a travel-related venture that includes ‘soul cleansing’, ‘spiritual road trips’ and ‘adventure experiences’. The lady, who has been doing a lot of rustic travel and spending most of her days in Auroville, is keen on getting this travel business off the ground.


Superstar’s thangachi!
South India’s multiplex head honcho, who fought off the popcorn fans of a certain multiplex when her company took it over, is touring India with none other than Rajinikanth himself. This self-made single mom has won the Superstar’s heart, we hear. He ensures she has eaten and has told people on his team to take care of “thangachi”! The secret — she has never once opened up about her sadness or struggles and has worked as hard as anyone else.



Good deed gets praise
The son of a medical college university’s head honcho, Chef Anish, works at a popular hotel in the city and can’t stop impressing guests. So much so that a lady who went as a chief guest to his dad’s university spoke about his culinary skills during an event! The reason, when kitchens were closed and no orders were being taken, this chef went out of his way to feed a hungry pack of women who were manhandled at a city protest.

Flavours of Rajasthan
Art gallery owner and social activist Meena Dadha, who is known for celeb-driven events held to raise awareness on the differently abled, has a legion of fans for her authentic Rajasthani food. A senior bureaucrat who visited their home recently was so impressed with her Papad Curry that he refused to take back some, but sent his wife the next day to learn how to make the dish.



Ishari throws party for stars
Ishari Ganesh’s New Year’s Eve dinner at his plush home in ECR saw the presence of a bevy of cine stars and loyalists. While the Nadigar Sangam election results have been withheld for various reasons, the significant few who turned up at his home assured him of their unswerving loyalty. A crowd even gathered outside his home to spot the celebs.



Cheating husband and his determined wife
Calling for an emergency meeting of her party pals, this young woman in the city, who works for a marketing agency, ensured she sent out teams of charged-up women to nab her cheating boyfriend. The fair-complexioned and rather chubby man is apparently two-timing this pretty lady with a skinny and sour-faced self-proclaimed industrialist and influencer who is also known for her foul temper at hotel lobbies when staff refuse to recognise her. These two have been cosying up at coffee shops and late-night cinemas.

But within three months, the storyline changed and recently, Aarti was replaced on the show. Ask her whether the sudden change in the script has upset her, and she says, “Not really. These things happen in our profession, it is not unusual. A love track was planned between Dr Shashank Gupta and Roshni Mathur (Mohnish and Aarti), but it didn’t take off as the makers felt that it was not required and so, it was better that I do not continue with the show.”

Producer Siddharth Malhotra shares, “It was unfortunate, but then everyone knows that such changes happen in TV shows. I did not want to waste Aarti’s talent and hard work because the focus is only on Sid and Ishani.”

Meanwhile, Seema Pandey has replaced Aarti on the show. Incidentally, Seema had played this character at the beginning of the show, but when the love track for Mohnish was incorporated into the script, Aarti was roped in."
"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Jeevan chose this script from the three that I narrated to him: Vadivudaiyan,"We’d reported a few months ago that Jeevan, after a hiatus of over four years, is all set to make a comeback in Kollywood with Asariri, a sound-based sci-fi film. And now, even as he’s busy filming it, the actor has signed his next — Pambattam. To be directed by VC Vadivudaiyan, the film will go on floors by the end of this month.

“It’s a horror thriller, and we will start shooting by January 20,” begins the director, “The film will be shot in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kerala and Mumbai, among other places. It will be a solid visual treat for our audience because we’ve zeroed in on some very beautiful locations and will also be doing extensive CG work.”


So, how did he rope in Jeevan? “He is one of those actors who would okay a film only if the complete script is ready. He believes in good screenplay. I narrated three scripts to him and he chose this one. I can say with confidence that the way the story will move, it will keep the audience on the edge of their seats,” he says.

Vadivudaiyan , who’s also helming the multi-lingual Veeramadevi, says Jeevan has been doing a lot of home work for his role in this film. “There are a lot of action blocks in the film, and so, he’s been training hard and also attending workshops. This film will give him a big break,” says the director, who also informs us that this film will be made in five languages. “We will be shooting the film in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi,” he signs off."

In a conversation with us, he spoke about plans to build a separate complex for Bengaluru International Film Festival, one wherein they can maintain archives to highlight of the glory of Kannada film industry as well as create small theatres at taluks across the state. Excerpts:
Dedicated venue for screening international films

Every year, a huge amount of money is spent on getting venues for conducting the Bengaluru International Film Festival. This expense can be reduced if we have a dedicated complex for screening the movies. When there is no festival, the venue can be kept active by carrying out film-related activities.


Archives can help keep our film legacy alive
Preservation of the works of legendary directors, actors, producers and technicians of the Kannada film industry is of utmost importance. When filmmakers from around the world come to Bengaluru, we should be able to acquaint them with the Kannada film industry. And if we have our archives in order, then all our delegates and visitors can see our contribution to world cinema. Plans are afoot to set up an advisory committee that comprises actors, directors and producers, who can suggest how we can take Sandalwood a notch higher.

Mini cinema halls are needed to screen content-driven movies


The academy is also planning to take content-driven films to smaller cities and taluks that have a population of more than 10,000. Many good films fail to reach smaller cities due to a lack of cinema halls. Building small theatres will also help develop the habit of watching quality movies among people.


Workshops for aspiring filmmakers

Budding filmmakers can use the academy as a platform to learn the nuances of acting and film direction. I have come across many young people, who are passionate about filmmaking, but cannot pursue it due to financial constraints. They also struggle to find the right guidance. By conducting regular workshops, we can ensure they get some help on this front."
"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,We write lyrics that resonate with the current generation: Ratty Adhiththa,"Today’s songs are all about catchy lyrics. Cashing in on the trend is Na Kudikka Poren by singers Ratty Adhiththan and Sahi Siva. With over one million views and counting, the singers, originally from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, are pretty kicked about the response.

Ask them about the making of this number and the story behind this catch phrase (also the title), Ratty, who resides in Paris now, says, “The title came about during a freestyle performance and I thought it would be a great Friday anthem song. It has a vibe that people can relate to and it is catchy. Hence, the name Naan Kudikka Poren. Cultural aspects are always hidden within our childhood. So, when making music we try to incorporate as much as possible into the hip hop elements of the music we make. The video was shot at various locations in France, particularly in Paris.” He adds, “I wrote the chorus and the rap verse, Sahi wrote my hook and second verse. Although we share elements of the creative process to ensure synchronisation, the song was sort of a work in progress over the last year.”


Music is a powerful tool to send out important messages, especially in times of crises. Did they appreciate the usage of this catch phrase? “Truth be told, everyone drinks and it’s just something that people need to accept. We do not intend to promote any sort of disrespectful or harmful behaviour. We simply write lyrics that will resonate with the current generation. The response to the song is based on this resonance that they have with the song and the vibe it brings,” says Sahi, who resides in UK now.

The genre of the number is varied... was that conscious? Says Sahi, “Fusion is something that we’ve always admired, and bringing together two different parallels of hip hop trap with the cultural elements, including the nadaswaram, worked out to be an extremely unique yet enjoyable. It’s something that we have explored and continue to explore in other songs, and with the right balance of both, the output will be great!”"
"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",P Sangeetha,Entertainment,'Quota' is about underprivileged children who do not get their due,"The year couldn’t have started on a better note for Coimbatore-based director P Amudhavanan. His feature film, Quota, has been selected for the PickurFlick Indie Film Festival Award December 2019. The film’s plot is about identifying and tapping the talents of underprivileged children who are denied opportunities due to their backgrounds.

An elated Amudhavanan says, “The plot revolves around a talented child from a tribal hamlet who yearns to become a gymnast. But, his economic condition and identity are a huge deterrent to his dream. Though the film begins with a tribute to the tribal freedom fighter and leader Birsa Munda, it does not focus on a particular caste or tribe. The spotlight is primarily on how children from underprivileged backgrounds continue to struggle to achieve their dreams, when it shouldn’t be so. Why can’t every talented child get his/her due?”


Amudhavanan’s maiden film Veruli was a thriller that dealt with potholes which became death traps. The director has shot Quota predominantly in a tribal hamlet in Mannarkad, Kerala. The star cast includes reality show talents and child artistes Bhavaz, Niharika and Aadhil. Chella of YouTube channel Nakkalites and Naresh, who acted in Maanasi, play crucial roles in it. The film is expected to hit screens after it completes the rounds on the festival circuit."

"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,Gully is everything: Divine,"Dressed in his characteristic black leather jacket and a cap, Vivian Fernandes is a man of few words. But say the word gully, and the idolised rapper’s eyes light up. “Gully is everything. That is where my journey began and it is something that I keep going back to,” the rapper says, flashing a smile, as we pulled him aside for a quick chat at his recent Gully Gang concert in Chennai.

Known better by his stage name, Divine, the underground rapping sensation is one of the main forces behind catapulting regional hip hop to Indian audiences. His inspiring journey from the streets of Mumbai found a prominent appearance in Zoya Akhtar’s breakout rap drama Gully Boy, which was inspired by Mumbai rappers Naezy and himself. The Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt-starrer traces the journey of a rapper from working-class Mumbai. Rapping, to Divine, is all about expressing stories from his community. His work often reflects his own personal experiences, which help him strike a connection with listeners, he says.


Representing Bombay and its stories was one of the reasons why Vivian wanted to become a musician. “One of the reasons I became a musician is to tell stories about my gully to people. I had so many stories I had to tell about Bombay and that is how my journey with hip hop began,” he says. His introduction to hip hop, too, has an interesting backstory. He once spotted his friend from school wearing a t-shirt of American rapper 50 Cent. “That was my first taste of hip hop. I wanted to know more about hip hop and from there I never stopped,” he adds. While he first equated hip hop to English music, he eventually realised that hip hop was whatever anyone wanted it to be. “I always thought hip hop was supposed to be in English. But I later realised that it is more than that. Someone had to tell stories of communities from every nook and corner,” Vivian says, adding that hip hop has grown leaps and bounds since he started out.

Did Gully Boy propel more people to embrace the genre? “I think the Bombay hip hop scene was already thriving even before the film released. But the big screen experience in India is truly something else. The film definitely helped catapult the emerging hip movement across the country in different regions. It also gave people a peek into the lives of musicians like us and perhaps even made them want to find out more about hip hop artistes in their own community or locality,” says the musician.


Like it is with many other cities, Chennai, too, has an emerging hip hop scene, he observed. “Chennai’s hip-hop scene is exciting, like it is in many parts of the country. I have come to perform in Chennai before in a college, but this is my first ever big concert here,” he says, further fondly recalling his collaborations with Madurai rap ensemble Madurai Souljour and Sid Sriram. “I recently collaborated with Sid Sriram for this song Too Hype from my album Kohinoor. We had such a fun time. Madurai Souljour and I, too, teamed up for a video song. The south hip-hop scene is definitely something to look forward to,” he adds with a grin, before going on to serenade his fans waiting a few metres away."

Paisa Paisa director Prasanth Murali is ready with his next film Lalbagh, with Mamta Mohandas playing the lead character named Sara, a Malayali nurse settled with family in Bengaluru.


The director says the film is a family-drama-cum-thriller that has a non-linear narrative pattern. “The film follows a birthday party, post which a murder happens, leading to a police interrogation,” he adds. As for the character of Sara, he says, “She is a normal Malayali woman who works as a nurse and lives with her husband and child. Hers is not an urban lifestyle. She has a rose garden in her balcony, and her mind is also like that of a flower. The film shows how she handles a particular crisis that happens in her life.”

Sijoy Varghese, Telugu actress Nandini Rai, Neha Saxena and renowned fashion choreographer Rahul Dev Shetty are also part of the movie’s cast. Prasanth says, “We have already wrapped up the shoot and currently, post production works are on. We are planning to bring out the film by March.”"
"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Jyothi Prabhakar,Entertainment,Music Review: Darbar,"Album: Darbar Composer: Anirudh Ravichander


Music Review: It isn’t a bad album, you know. But do the songs of Darbar weave the same magic that Petta’s songs did? Sadly, no. In fact, some of Darbar’s songs sound like hastily re-arranged Petta songs... disappointing the Anirudh fan in you... So, you end up in a déjà vu situation, trying to recall where you heard all of this before, like the ‘Rebara Rebara Rebara’ refrain... And, there’s a lot of musical noise that drown out the lyrics, which are no great either. Vivek’s lyrics are a bunch of non-sensical words thrown in to sound trendy, with the ‘u’ added after each one to make them rhyme (really?), padded up with the swag and arrogance of Rajinisms. Music-wise, you get a sense of flat champagne. More of a revisiting of older Rajini songs and not a creation of new Rajini moments. Composer Anirudh Ravichander, the lyricists, all have fallen into the classic trap all Rajini’s movies fall into – that of eulogising the actor, instead of going by the situational and thematic demands of the script. Ani has tailored the songs around Rajini, and that’s where the beats falter.


Let’s begin with Tharam Maara, sung by Anirudh and Arjun Chandy. Average, one of many such songs. They say it’s a romantic number. But with lyrics that go ‘Romance a indha face la varalanalum’ and a ‘reba rebara’ refrain... only one question here: Thevaiya? Next, Thalaivar Theme. Trumpets, trombone, all ‘kingly’ instruments push the rhythm along, only to be let down by the intermittent chorus of ‘Thalaiva’ (remember Shah Rukh Khan’s All the Rajini Fans, Thalaiva!).

That brings us to Chumma Kizhi, the very first song that this team released. Anyone who’s listened to Marana Mass will end up comparing the two and find Chumma Kizhi unnecessarily kuthu-ish, and wanting in oomph. Let’s hope wordplay like ‘Billa en Varalaaru’ gives this one some whistle-podu moments in the theatres. Also, this one is that ‘lucky’ must-paatu in all Rajini movies, the one that’s sung by SP Balasubrahmanyam (along with Anirudh Ravichander, in this case). But the best part of this song? Rajini closing the song with his signature laugh and a ‘Chumma Kizhi’.


Thani Vazhi is a rap in which Yogi B spews nonsense, with Anirudh and Shakthisree Gopalan joining in here and there... Unsurprisingly, lyrics are by Yogi B, Senthuzhan and Syan — which is laughable as the lyrics are actually Rajini’s film dialogues. But this is that song in which the much-touted punch-phrase, ‘Adhisayam-arputham’ finds mention. Then there’s Dumm Dumm — sung by Nakash Aziz. The nadaswaram, tabla, mandolin, and the lyrical refrain make it appear to be a wedding song, and somehow, you feel like listening to it again. And finally, the Villain Theme. A synth composition by Anirudh. Remember the music that’d come up each time Vijay Sethupathi came on screen in Petta? We aren’t saying anything pa — you listen to it and tell us, same-same feeling varadha, illaya?"

The film was supposed to start earlier, but due to the actor’s busy schedule, the filmmaker went ahead with Sasikumar-starrer MGR Magan. According to him, the work on finalising the cast and crew will start in February, and the movie will go on floors in May.

He says, “The script has been locked after making a few corrections in the second half. Karthik Subbaraj’s company is associating with it and we are currently in talks with a leading production company, too. Set against the backdrop of Dindigul, the film will be a rural masala entertainer with ample dose of comedy, love and action. But it will be different from the kind of films I have done with Sivakarthikeyan. The character written for Vijay Sethupathi is tailor-made for him.”"

The Maya actor will henceforth be called Aari Arujuna, he informs.

“We currently have Aadhi, Arya and Aari in the industry, and given that these names sound similar, it was leading to confusion. I have been called Aadhi on many occasions and I decided that this new year would be a great time put a full-stop to this. Since going for an entirely new name would lead to people mistaking my name for a newcomer’s, I started looking at names that would go well with Aari and zeroed in on Arujuna,” explains the actor.


The actor has signed a new film that will be directed by Albert Raja, who has assisted Jeeva Shankar in Amarakaviyam and Yeman. “It is an action thriller, and my character is that of a boy-next-door. This normal youngster gets into an extraordinary situation and what happens after that forms the plot,” says the actor.

The supporting cast includes Yogi Babu, Nasser, Senthil and Kovai Sarala, who are teaming up after a long time. Kolaigaran fame Simon K King is scoring the music for this film, which will go on floors in February."
"Created: Jan 4, 2020, 00:01 IST",Harshada Rege,Entertainment,Gerard Butler’s day in Varanasi,"Hollywood star Gerard Butler brought in the New Year in India. The actor met the Dalai Lama and visited Rishikesh before spending a day in Varanasi on January 1. During his stay, Gerard and girlfriend Morgan Brown visited a foundation that works towards social causes. Varanasi-based social entrepreneur, Avinav Peshwani, who spent many hours with the 300 actor, said, “Gerard got to know about our Aghor foundation and wanted to visit it. When I met him, I asked him, ‘Are you actually Gerard Butler?’ He replied, ‘Yes, people usually call me by that name.’ We spoke a lot about spirituality. He was also keen to know about Varanasi, which is considered to be among the oldest standing cities in the world. He was very down to earth.”

While the morning was spent at Bal Ashram, the foundation’s shelter for destitute children, Gerard and Morgan walked around the city and the ghats in the evening. They also visited a few local houses to see the traditional structures.


Gerard recalls his first visit to Varanasi

In a video that Avinav shared on social media, Gerard says, “I came to Varanasi 10 years ago when I was travelling with seven friends. It was tough because everyone wanted to do something different until we arrived in Varanasi. When I arrived here, I felt completely high. I meditated on the banks of the Ganges. I did a private pooja, which was so powerful. That night, I went to the Ganga aarti and I remember sitting on one of the boats there and thinking this is the best day I have ever had in my life. It was magical and mystical against the backdrop of this ancient city. Even then, I remember the guide taking us through a city that was so busy, but everyone was smiling. There’s an order in chaos and a lot of heart and love (sic).”"

In the latest episode, Shehnaz and Paras sit down in the captain's room and sort out their differences.

During their discussion, Shehnaz tells Paras to make Sidharth understand that he should not have problems when she talks to other. He assures her that he will talk to Sidharth about it. Later, Paras talks to Sidharth and tells him about his conversation with Shehnaz. He tells Sidharth that Sana doesn't like when he stops her from talking to others. Sidharth gets furious hearing this and tells Paras he has never done that. He only tries to protect her. He tells him, he doesn't like Shehnaz' attitude as she behaves all goody goody with Asim and others after his fight with them. Sidharth and Shehnaz talk and he tells her that from now on he will not stop her when she is going wrong. He also adds that people can take advantage of her in wholesale.


Sidharth and Shehnaz continue to have fights throughout the day. Later, when during the night Sidharth is seen having a conversation with Paras, Shefali and Mahira, Shehnaz comes there and orders Sidharth to come inside and sleep. Sidharth gets angry and says he doesn't want to sleep now, but she forces him to come inside the room and sleep. She acts possessive with Sidharth and the latter doesn't like it. She tells him she won't be able to sleep until he doesn't sleep beside her and Sidharth makes faces.

Coming back to Paras' discussion with Shehnaz they also discuss about the problems Shehnaz and Mahira have with each other. Sidharth, who is also sitting with them gets bored and walks out. He goes and sit with Mahira, Arti and Shefali Jariwala. He plans to trouble Shehnaz and interrupts her when she is talking to Paras. He tells her, he is bored and can't sit for so long outside. Sidharth, Paras and Shehnaz both have a hearty laugh over his joke."

,"Created: Jan 5, 2020, 00:00 IST",Lifestyle,Live it up in 2020,"The New Year looks like a mixed bag of traditional wisdom and space-age endeavours; functional fitness and micro regional flavours. All in all, it looks like a year of promise and mindful choices.
SPACE IT OUT
The world will witness the birth of a completely new travel sector in the 2020s – sub-orbital business aircraft and intergalactic hotels. Going forward, everyday cosmonauts will get to experience total weightlessness and see Earth’s curvature below them. NASA will begin selling passenger tickets to the International Space Station (ISS) for US$ 35,000 a night. Space X or Boeing will be providing flights. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin Space Company hopes to launch crewed test flights of its New Shepard craft in 2020, in preparation for sending its first space tourists.

ECO-FRIENDLY TRAVEL
From the introduction of vegan hotels to a plethora of sustainable initiatives like eco-aware hotels that eliminate plastics, introduce ‘give-back’ activities and use local produce and communities in hotels, it has become easier to travel more ethically. According to the Vegan Society, if the whole world went meat-free by 2050, it would save eight million human lives and reduce greenhouse gases by two thirds. Moreover, with the rise in ‘flygskam’ (or ‘flight shaming’) coupled with ‘tagskyrt’ (or ‘train-bragging’) — two Swedish terms which seem to capture the zeitgeist and which are all the rage on social media — conscious travellers are also turning to alternative modes of transport as opposed to flying.
GRANDMA DIET
From heirloom recipes to nutritional advice, there’s no food better than your grandma’s. Dieticians are encouraging patients to think in terms of what grandma used to eat back then. It’s just a different way to think about how reliant we’ve become on processed food. If we can think about Grandma, or great-Grandma, who made most food from scratch, it can help us get back to a healthier way of eating. In the early 1900s, 80 per cent of individuals lived on family farms where physical activity was part of their livelihood and routine. Whether on farms or in smaller gardens, people grew their own vegetables. That’s what we are going back to.

WORKING OUT... NOT FOR WEIGHT LOSS
In case our own endorphins weren’t proof enough, evidence is mounting that there are plenty of reasons to exercise which have nothing to do with physical appearance: Cortisol-conscious workouts focused on reducing stress are on the rise, and studies have shown that the mental benefits of exercise can help with mental health issues including anxiety and depression. Mindful workouts and functional fitness will continue to grow bigger in 2020. Maintaining a good body weight will still be an objective but definitely not the topmost priority. Thanks to the Body Positivity movement, attaining a bikini body is no more the goal.

SPIRIT APPRECIATION BREAK
You’ve heard of wine and spirit tasting tours and bar crawls during a travel break. This year will be about wine and whiskey residencies where you are booked in a villa and a spirit expert takes you through the appreciation process. Rather than visiting a distillery or a vineyard, expect these residencies to be big this year – here you get to sample a vintage brew or a range of products of a certain year and pair the drinks with different cuisines over a period of two nights and three days.

UBER LUXE STAYS
There has been a noticeable rise in groups of friends and family clubbing together to rent holiday villas, chalets and high-end homes with butler services. These quirky as well as beautiful villas come with swimming pools, in-house theatres, gyms as well as a degree of exclusivity, novelty and informality that hotels cannot match. Luxurious home stays offer an ideal setting for bonding and reconnecting with loved ones. Another plus point is that a majority of such villas are pet-friendly and have sufficient space for your furry friends to play around. The concept of weekend getaways to a fancy homestay is only likely to gain more popularity this year.

OWN YOUR HEALTH
In the New Year, we will get more responsible for our own health, and the health of those for whom we shop and cook. Your health starts at the kitchen table. Homemakers and chefs will be more focused on health, mindful eating, sustainable foods and lifestyles, and fitness. From more calming foods for anxiety, nootropics to boost the brain and plant-based food to cleanse the body, the mantra for 2020 will be ‘food to fuel the mind, body and spirit’.


HYPER REGIONAL FOOD
Regional food will be broken into micro-regions. Language and food changes every 100 km in India. Then how can you have Rajasthani or Awadhi as a broad category? This will be the year of micro-regional cuisines. Chefs will speak of the cuisine of a community, a locality or just a lane than merely stating it’s a regional Indian cuisine. Expect menus to be inspired by the fishermen community in Koliwada, Punjabi food of Uttarakhand’s Sikh community, coastal cuisine of small towns in Kerala or desserts from Madhya Pradesh. If not the cuisine, then there would be micro regional ingredient influences where you can expect a lot of fusion preparations where popular dishes are cooked using spices and herbs from a particular district or farm.


SENIOR AND JUNIOR FITNESS
Among people hitting health clubs, a new category will be senior citizens and kids. Increasingly, older adults are turning to smartwatches and fitness trackers to monitor everything from heart rate to steps taken. There will be certified trainers specialising in fitness programmes for adults, helping them with recovery, flexibility and knee issues. Similarly, kids will be seen hitting the gym to learn better posture, body movement and alignment.


EXERCISE IS MEDICINE
Gyms will be employing sports nutritionists and certified fitness professionals instead of body builders. Exercise will be one of the more prescribed forms of treatment for patients who are experiencing a range of disorders. As a result, physiotherapy will get more popular and people will be encouraged to engage in some form of exercise to maintain good health. This is an aspect that will be seen as essential, even for those not facing any immediate medical conditions."

Some of these substances help the body produce melatonin, the hormone that is responsible for regulating your circadian rhythm (sleep/wake patterns). Magnesium is a powerful mineral that is instrumental in sleep and is a natural relaxant that helps deactivate adrenaline. In fact, it is often referred to as the sleep mineral. Calcium is another mineral that helps the brain make melatonin. A lack of calcium can cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and have difficulty returning to sleep. Some foods are naturally packed with these essential vitamins and minerals. Here’s a list:

For tryptophan, have dairy products (milk, low-fat yogurt, cheese); poultry (turkey, chicken); seafood (shrimp, salmon, halibut, tuna, sardines, cod); nuts and seeds (flax, sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, cashews, peanuts, almonds, walnuts).

For magnesium have dark leafy greens (baby spinach, kale, collard greens), wheat germ, fish (salmon, halibut, tuna, and mackerel), soybeans, and banana.

For calcium, have low-fat milk, cheeses, yogurt, sardines, fortified cereals and soybeans.

For Vitamin B6, have sunflower seeds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, fish (tuna, salmon, and halibut), and dried prunes. For melatonin, have fruits and vegetables like corn, asparagus, tomatoes, pomegranate, olives, grapes, broccoli, cucumber; grains like rice, barley, rolled oats and nuts and seeds.


Foods high in fat have been linked to poor, fragmented sleep. Fat triggers the digestive processes and causes a build-up of stomach acids, which while lying down can cause discomfort"

The Shivarajkumar-starrer, which sees the actor teaming up with director A Harsha for the third time, has led to much curiosity as the team has not been forthcoming with any publicity material from the movie. In a first, the look of the leading lady Bhavana is now available with BT.

Director Harsha shares that a lot of brain storming went into creating this get-up for Bhavana. “Having been seen as the girl-next-door in most of her films until now, this is a character that is clearly a first for Bhavana. While revealing anything more about her character might be a spoiler, her gritty and fierce avatar will surely be a sign of the things to come,” points out Harsha. The actress, he adds, is slated for a knockout performance as she pairs with Shivarajkumar for the second time, after Tagaru. “It’s an intriguing character and her look will only add further gravitas,” says Harsha. Shivarajkumar, too, sports an interesting look, which is a highlight.


Harsha tells us that he plans to introduce the seven main characters of his film — who have all got stunning makeovers — one by one in subsequent weeks. Bhajarangi 2 shoot is currently underway at Shivamogga, the team also shot at Sakrebailu Elephant Camp on Friday."

The tendency will be to look for divisions that grant greater privacy and intimacy to each space.

Cool & Comfy
Casual is the new cool. A living room built for loun-ging is here to stay. We are doing to see more inviting furniture and decor (in rich jewel tones of green and blue), bright pillows and coffee tables and other surfaces made out of wood, stone, marble or other natural materials. Milan Design Week predicts that this year, humble materials like rattan, plywood, jute, sisal, hemp and terracotta will be used more than ever. Wabi-sabi and burnt wood are also coming back.
Minimal, but Personal
Minimal spaces with personalisation will be in. Don’t chuck all your possessions, but try some “intimate minimalism”. Create an intimate nook with a curated shelf housed with select knick-knacks. The idea is to own less but make use of more things and to opt for multifunctional and compact design. Furniture will become increasingly multipurpose, movable, and modular. There will be a move towards use of organic resources, with classic styles that don’t go out of fashion. Wood, glass and stone will be the home decor materials of choice .

Return of Carpets
The carpet was literally everywhere during Milan Design Week 2019 and is being predicted as a big trend for 2020. You can put it on the floor but also hang it on the wall or fix it on the ceiling.

Handleless Cabinets
The latest contemporary designs are all about a multi-tasking and free-flowing design. Technological advances has made it possible to dispense off with handles in both wall and base cabinets. Handleless kitchen cabinets are one of the biggest trends this year for a more streamlined look. It’s all about simplicity and a focus on cabinetry details.

Curves
Curves and round shapes are associates with classic design. Give your home a retro twist as you use furniture with curved shapes, rounded corners.

Integrated Kitchen & Dining Room
Interior design in 2020 gives prominence to the kitchen, increasing its dimensions and connecting it with the dining and living room as the main entertainment space. There’s a rise of interactive dining spaces.

Terracotta
From vases to plants to walls – terracotta is going to dominate this year. A warm, natural material, you can even use terracotta coating for a wall. It creates an earthy look.

Oversized plants
Big, huge plants indoors is all set to go bigger as indoor plants and plant-like accessories go oversized. Blending with nature and relaxing is one of the defining interior trends for 2020.

Don’t be matchy-matchy
Mix and match your decor items but don’t go for matching shades. Pick a complementary colour palette for boho-chic style that feels cohesive but non-conforming. You will feel more energetic and adventurous in this ethos as the idea is that since nothing in the room is perfect, you really can relax in it.

"Created: Jan 5, 2020, 00:00 IST",Shikha Shah,Lifestyle,Beauty in blue,"Classic Blue is certainly an all-inclusive trend that’s not only hot in fashion but in make-up too. In fact, the cool and striking shade is already inspiring countless beauty and make-up looks. Think classic blue eye liner, eye shadow and nail varnish. Yes, coloured eyeliner is a major trend for the coming season and has been a rage at catwalks around the world. “Blue is a very flattering colour for the Indian skin tone. Apart from a simple blue eyeliner, you can try blue eye shadow or a thick line of blue-coloured shadow above a black eyeliner, while lining the lower lid only with the coloured shadow. Blue can also be used only to line the outer corners of the eyes, or just the inner corners of the eyes. For a softer look, blend the blue-coloured shadow from dark to light, from the eyelids going upwards. The colour should be lighter above the crease,” says beauty expert Shahnaz Husain.


“Alternatively, nude make-up for the eyes can be paired with bold lips. Those who like to experiment can try a classic blue lipstick with a pearly finish,” adds Husain.
Classic blue has a rare quality of making you look cool or glamorous, depending on how you use the hue in your make-up. While a simple blue liner can go well with a casual ensemble, dark blue glittery eyeshadow can have a magical effect for a night out with friends or a glitzy evening on the red carpet.


When using classic blue in make-up, it is necessary to keep the colour of the dress in mind. For instance, a green coloured outfit with blue eye shadow or eyeliner would really clash. A light coloured, grey, white or light blue shimmering dress would go with blue make-up colours. Blue eye shadow or liner would go best with dark brown or black hair.


MAKE-UP NOTES

- Little is enough

- Focus on one feature only – lips or eyes

- When using classic blue, keep the skin clean and complexion dewy and flawless. A light coverage foundation works well

- Balance blue lips or eyes with a neutral cheek highlighter"
"Created: Jan 5, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nupur Amarnath,Lifestyle,An yearful of trends,"A bit of crystal gazing for the year ahead on what is bound to keep you stylish in 2020

1. Suit yourself

The suits are here to stay and 2020 is going to see a variety of them from classic tailored ones to sexy draped silhouettes. In fact, pant suits were a big trend last year and many celebrities endorsed the look – globally and in India. It will continue to get more attention and is only bound to get edgier with more attention to detail, styles and a lot of embroidery. This power trend lets you walk in like a boss.
2. Explosion of
social e-commerce
The process of making purchases directly on a social media platform has been increasingly gaining ground over the past few years and this trend will continue onwards as we move into 2020. As consumers turn to social media for product recommendations and reviews before making a purchase decision, naturally, the concept of social commerce is gaining momentum.

3. Be bold
The year 2020 is all about wearing your fashion statement on your sleeve – and it’s not understated. From bold colour blocking with bright and statement-making hues clubbed together to bolder accessories, the name of the game is to not be subtle. There’ll be more layering, be it clothes or jewellery. Everything will be exaggerated like dramatic sleeve, big earrings to oversized sunglasses and bags. This is the year of high-volume dresses, playful feathers, bold neons, statement retro prints, and dramatic fringes.

4. Getting ‘woke’
Consumers now increasingly back their beliefs with their shopping habits, favouring brands that are aligned with their values and avoiding those that aren’t. There’s a growing non-acceptance in the world of fashion when it comes to lack of diversity and uninspiring or unoriginal brand philosophies. However, as major brands continue to adapt their business models to this trend, customers will be more skeptical than ever regarding how sincere these efforts are. Fast fashion will slow down with more people buying clothes that are easily mixed and matching and upcycled rather than single statement pieces. There’s a rise in re-sales, swaps and second-hand market.

5. Ruffle it up
Ruffles and gathers rather MORE ruffles and gathers is an undying trend that will continue to rule the fashion runway. It is the perfect dose of drama.

6. Designer
collaborations
As consumers look for innovation in design and a chance to own high-end products at a much affordable price, designer collaborations are expected to become even bigger this year.

7. Leather is back
In small ways and big, from detailings and trims to two-piece co-ords, leather is here to stay. But given the current ‘woke’ fashion trend, many will opt for faux or cruelty-free leather – basically vegan leather is going to be big.

8. time for comebacks
Fashion has been in a cycle of revival for some time. And 2020 is no different. The puffy Victorian sleeve is all set to be one of the biggest trends as are the retro prints. Be it 60s inspired florals or retro, the more drama you can create, the better. With the return of graphic polka dots, disco collars, ’60s wallpaper prints, hot pants and dramatic feathers – 2020 will see a lot many comebacks.

9. Dots the way

Polka dots are back and how. This all-time classic is back on any outfit whether contemporary, Indian or western. This year dots will be seen on accessories too from shoes, bags and even hair clips. Men can also incorporate polka dots in the form of oversized sweatshirts, pocket squares or scarfs.


10. What’s more?

This will be the year of fringes and tassels and they are likely to be everywhere from cropped jackets to fringe-adorned boots. In terms of colours, yellow and all its shades are back as a trend. In fact, marigold shade — a cusp between gold and mustard — is going to be ‘the’ pick for both men and women. Also, among other accents, glitter and sequins will move from party wear to everyday wear.

,"Updated: Jan 5, 2020, 11:43 IST",Entertainment,Will Hema Commission report shake up the cinema industry?,"The report by Justice Hema Commission that studied the issues faced by women in Malayalam film industry has made way for debates across Kerala. The study by the committee headed by retired High Court judge K Hema and veteran actor Sharada and former bureaucrat K B Valsala Kumari as members, has confirmed the practices of casting couch, unofficial bans and gender discrimination in the industry.
While talking to Kochi Times, in an exclusive interview, Justice Hema revealed that making a demand for sex in return for a role or job and denying the person the opportunity if they resist exists only in cinema. “Everybody says sexual harassment in workplace is there everywhere, but you need to understand that casting couch exists only in the film industry. If somehow they manage to get a film and then they express resentment against ‘compromises’, the torture begins. Also, there are many human rights and constitutional violations. Film is not a world that we imagine,” she said.

Adding further she said, ""Women in cinema and men too, face unofficial bans. If a woman refuses to oblige or expresses her resentment to sexual harassment at workplace, she is banned from cinema, for no fault of hers."" Justice Hema also urged that a tribunal should be formed, and statute should be implemented. That alone will be a solution to the injustice in Malayalam film industry. Those from the film industry react to the findings of the report.

‘This is not a unique discovery. Such problems exist everywhere’
Edavela Babu, general secretary of AMMA

Nothing in the report is related to us (AMMA). Only Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce and Kerala Film Producers Association can act based on the findings and formulate rules. There is nothing new in the study. They have only reported whatever we have been saying. Casting couch is something people here have been discussing for a long time and we should understand that it exists across the world. It isn’t something that Mollywood has discovered. ‘Compromise’ and ‘adjustment’ are individual decisions. If one decides to resist it, they won’t succumb to it. Also, I think it is about the talent here. However, if the commission says that it has happened to nearly every woman in the industry, it is an insult. I don’t deny the existence of casting couch, but we all know that it is happening in every other field. We all know how things work and if anybody has objection, let them come out. Also, let the commission reveal the names. Nothing is going to change.


‘Issues can be resolved through constructive dialogues between government and producers’
B Unnikrishnan, FEFKA official and filmmaker

We have been actively trying to bring in changes in the industry through various organisations, and the commission’s findings include things that even we aren’t aware of. They have interviewed 57 people, a cross section of Malayalam cinema, who have boldly spoken to the commission about the difficulties they have faced. The report can be used as a guideline for the betterment of the industry and we can plan corrective measures too. While implementing a new law, we need to keep in mind that we already have a strong and powerful law like POSH that addresses sexual harassment at work place and this can be extended to any field of work. In every other field, it is easy to implement these laws but when it comes to films, the employer keeps changing. So, what should happen is that the producers association and the government should have a constructive dialogue to implement the existing law itself.


‘Women need a respectful and healthy workspace in cinema. Laws should be implemented’
Rajeev Ravi, filmmaker and cinematographer

The issues mentioned by the commission have been open secrets in the industry. And it is really bad. We have never allowed such people to work with us. Things would have been better if the #MeToo movement that started off with great momentum had continued in the same pace in Mollywood. But it did not. Instead it ended with Alencier and Vinayakan. Women need a healthy and happy workspace. They should be respected and if there is a complaint, that should be heard, and they should be encouraged and supported to speak up and work, instead of their dignity being questioned. Considering the findings and suggestions, we need to ensure that the laws are implemented. People should point out the names of those who perpetuate these malpractices to mitigate these. It is important that those handling arts should bring in change and equality.


‘What would be the future of those who complain?’
Mala Parvathy, actress


Production controllers are the ones who rule the shooting sets. How they treat us depends on their temperaments. Some are extremely caring and are ready to give loo breaks amid the shoot. But there are also those who don’t even consider us as humans. I have fought even for water in the sets. During the shoot of Happy Sardar, I finally rented a caravan on my own expense as I couldn’t control not using a washroom for 16 hours. That became an issue. I am an optimistic person and I look at the tribunal positively. But I wonder what will be the future of those who complain? Whoever has complained will not be supported by the industry and we cannot prove that they are avoiding us due to our grievance. This is a market-driven industry and it is all about comfort zones. So, I am not sure how justice can be done. However, things are changing, and I am glad.


‘We now have a solid document. The next step is transformation’
Asha Joseph, academician and WCC member


We should be proud that Kerala and the Malayalam film industry have joined the discussions on gender parity while it happened all over the world. Thanks to our awareness and receptiveness, we are different from other States and also we were able to identify the discrimination. We have crossed the first hurdle. Through Hema Commission, we have also documented it now. This can be considered as the base for all upcoming discussions. Now, we can think of how to transform. We are in a hopeful space now. This can be done through creating awareness in the society. Such issues are prevalent in every field where women are less visible. It is important to bring in equality and gender inclusivity to make the industry healthy one."

Dressed in a gorgeous ethnic gown, her choice of footwear is white sneakers. ‘Comfort comes first’, she chuckles before elaborating on finding the airport and gym looks amusing. You can’t help but notice that Kajol is an amalgamation of her popular screen characters. She is as family oriented as Simran from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), as vulnerable as Anjali from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' (KKHH) and as vivacious, chirpy and rooted in her culture as Anjali in 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (K3G). In a chat with BT, the actress talks about motherhood being a role that’s a work in progress, career post marriage and the upcoming home production, 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior', with husband Ajay Devgn. Excerpts...
The New Year is all about setting new goals and changing things that are long overdue. Is there anything that you’d like to change about yourself?
I am perfect the way I am. I don’t want to change anything about myself except for what will happen organically. I don’t like too many changes. I actually like a nice boring life, routine is underrated. For me, no news is good news. When people ask me, ‘What’s happening in your life?’ or ‘What’s new?’, I tell them, ‘Nothing, really. I am doing the same old s**t and loving every bit of it’. There is no hot gossip in my life whatsoever.


When we think of Kajol, we think of Shah Rukh Khan and vice versa. You two have epitomised romance in cinema. What do you think makes your screen chemistry so special?
The first two films — 'Baazigar' (1993) and 'Karan Arjun' (1995) — that we did together, worked so well that there was no looking back. Be it 'DDLJ' (1995), 'KKHH' (1998), 'K3G' (2001) or 'My Name Is Khan' (2010), we have been lucky with the kind of films that we got to do. Also, it matters whether you get along with your co-star. We were and still are good friends. We are extremely comfortable around each other and that translates on screen and creates that chemistry you are talking about. When we do a scene, he knows exactly what I am going to do and vice versa.
Speaking of chemistry, you play Savitribai Malusare, the fearless wife of warrior Tanhaji Malusare (played by Ajay Devgn) in your upcoming home production, 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'. You have worked with Ajay before. So, what happens when real and reel equations coincide?
We have worked together in many films, and at home also, we work together (smiles!). So, we are used to it. Ajay is the same, be it at home or on the set, and I have always loved that about him. He doesn’t change according to the environment. I am a talkative person, while he is extra quiet.

Over the past few years, we have seen many historicals courting controversies. They are either accused of misrepresenting facts, or hurting the sentiments of a particular section/community. Were you apprehensive about such a possibility while making 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'?
We have tried not to offend anyone. Of course, we have taken certain cinematic liberties, but we have tried to be as authentic as possible. Having said that, you can’t keep everyone happy. These days, everyone has an opinion and they have platforms to voice it. We just have to wait for the film to release and judge it after watching it.

You talked about social media giving everyone a platform to voice their opinion. Of course, social media gives more opportunities, but it also builds up the pressure to be perfect at all times, isn’t it?
There is definitely more pressure on today’s generation of stars to be perfectly turned out at all times, even when they are coming out of a gym. Those pictures are shockingly good. Thank God, nobody sees me in the gym, because it’s not a pretty sight! Yes, the pressure is more, but so are the opportunities. When we did films in the past, you either failed dramatically or succeeded dramatically. There was no middle ground. Today, there is that nice, happy middle ground where everyone doesn’t have to be number one. It’s a more secure place for them to be. Even if you don’t want to work in films as actors, there are so many other things to do. You can start your own business, be it in fashion or film production, and people won’t look down and say, ‘Oh! She is starting her own business because she is not doing well in films’. That fear is not there anymore. Also, you can act and simultaneously do these things. So many actors today are doing so many things at the same time, it is all about being able to multitask.

Yes, so many norms and conventions have changed over the past few years. But, you were always a rule-breaker, weren’t you? You got married at the age of 25, when you were at the peak of your career. Then, 'DDLJ' brought in a fashion revolution of sorts… minimal make-up, simple hairdos, backless gowns and satin saris...
I have always been like that. I am too lazy and that came across as rule-breaking (laughs!). I was stubborn and yes, I did make certain choices which were a little unusual. I usually go by my instinct, whether it is films or other choices in life. The story needs to work for me before I give a nod to a film. As far as getting married early is concerned, I don’t think that it was a big deal even back then. You had Sharmila Tagore, my mother Tanuja, Sadhana, Saira Banu… all of them continued doing films after marriage. Today, almost every woman continues to work after marriage and that’s fabulous.

Did you see any difference in the roles that were offered to you after marriage? Was there a change in filmmakers’ perception of you?
After marriage, I felt that I had the freedom to choose different films. I didn’t want to do run-of-the-mill films. Not that I ever wanted to do such movies, but at one point, I know that I may have. Today, the opportunities are huge as the writing in cinema is better.


You have two kids and your elder daughter Nysa is a teenager. Like your character in 'Helicopter Eela' (2018), are you an obsessive and interfering parent?
There are times when every mother gets hyper and protective about her children. I have hopefully drawn myself back, but there are momentary lapses. So, I swing between being Helicopter Eela and myself. I keep telling myself, ‘Remember what you were like when you were 16’. I am relatively more chilled out, while Ajay gets more hyper about them.


What do you make of the paparazzi culture, and the birth of airport and gym looks? Have you tried to keep pace, or just let it be?
I am convinced that this airport culture is in everyone’s heads. Have you seen regular people at the airport? Sweatshirts, jeans and sports shoes — 90 per cent of people wear this. The remaining almost 10 per cent wear uniforms because they are airport personnel. Only point one per cent people wear heels and walk out with their hair perfectly styled and in fashionable clothes, like they have just stepped out of a salon and right onto the red carpet. I don’t know what to say! Even the gym look, I wonder if they go to the gym and then to the parlour and then step out! The hair looks blow-dried, and they wear perfect clothes that match the shoes. The whole look is colour coordinated. You will not see them repeating gym clothes, while I have two pairs of gym wear. Also, I don’t know how people even shoot those gym videos. Placing the camera in the right angle to capture the workout… You have no clue how much effort they have to take to look that way. I choose not to take everything too seriously. We need to stop making a big deal out of everything. If your photograph did not get the maximum likes on Instagram, it’s fine (laughs!). I use this platform for fun. The minute it starts feeling like work, I will disconnect from it. I have realised the importance of social media and it does make a difference to me, but I cannot make it my bread and butter. I can’t be stressed about what I am going to post two days from now and uska caption kya hoga.


At a time when we obsess over perfection, what would you advise a youngster, who wants to make a foray into acting?
Please don’t think that if you change your nose or lips to look like someone, you, too, will stand out. You won’t. It’s a myth. If you get Katrina Kaif’s nose or someone’s cheek bones or someone’s lips, you won’t stand out. It will not make your career more interesting or your rise meteoric. It will do nothing except make you blend in, when you actually want to stand out. Focus on who you are and your work. Also, if you want to enhance your face, there’s always make-up. It is meant to correct what you think is slightly lacking in your face. I won’t say flaws, as every face is unique, but if you think something is lacking, use make-up instead."
"Created: Jan 5, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Aly Goni: I am extremely happy for Natasa Stankovic,"The news of cricketer Hardik Pandya getting engaged to Serbian model-actress Natasa Stankovic took everyone by surprise. A few months ago, she had participated in the dance reality show, 'Nach Baliye', with her ex-boyfriend, TV actor Aly Goni, who she dated for a year in 2014. The two, as exes, had put up some good performances on the show and were the third runners-up. TOI spoke to Aly after Natasa’s recent engagement, and he said, “Natasa told me about her relationship with Hardik some time ago. She really loves him a lot and so does he. I remember, during 'Nach Baliye', he would often call to check on her. They look nice together and I am very happy for her. They make a perfect match. Natasa is a darling; she is sweet and caring.”
So, was he aware of their engagement plan? “No, I wasn’t. Even Natasa was taken by surprise; or else, she would have told me because we are close. I messaged her and she said that the feeling is still sinking in,” he replied.

Aly hasn’t met Hardik yet. He said, “I have spoken to him a couple of times, as Natasa and I would practically be together for eight-nine hours rehearsing for 'Nach Baliye'. I plan to meet them soon and congratulate them in person.”

During the show, Aly and Natasa were inseparable, and their camaraderie even led to speculations that they might rekindle their romance. However, Aly said that it was never a possibility. It’s funny how some people are reacting to this news (of Natasa’s engagement) on social media. They are making memes on it with me crying in the background to the song, 'Channa Mereya' ('Ae Dil Hai Mushkil') (laughs!). I have also been inundated with sympathy messages. What’s wrong with these people? I guess they can’t envision two exes becoming friends, as they might not be capable of it. Natasa and I were sure that we won’t get back into a relationship with each other again. We attempted it once previously, but it didn’t work out. However, our split hasn’t changed our equation. We were very young when we started dating. Even then, we were buddies first. We parted on a good note and continue to be great friends. That’s also a reason why I could participate with her on Nach Baliye. I don’t think I would have been able to do that with anyone else.”


Aly, who has featured in shows like 'Yeh Hai Mohabbatein' and 'Naagin 3', has often been linked with actress Jasmin Bhasin, who was his fellow contestant in 'Khatron Ke Khiladi'. When asked about it, he said, “I don’t know how to define our relationship, it’s a pure and good friendship. Jasmin is closest to me. She is more than a best friend. I don’t have many friends in the industry. We talk to each other about everything under the sun, and I always make fun of her. I don’t want to give it a tag, as I don’t want to make it ugly. For now, friendship is a better bond. If there could be anything more than that, I am not sure about it yet.”


Calling himself “commitment phobic”, he added, “I am focussing on work at the moment. Also, I would want to marry someone who is not from the industry. I aspire to lead a normal life when I am not working. I would want to talk beyond just ‘lights, camera and action’.”


On the work front, the actor has taken time out from fiction shows. “I am working on myself and will be back in action soon,” he signed off."

Anupama, who is on an eight-day trip to the country, has been posting pictures from her maiden solo trip. “A lot of people around me were going on solo trips, and initially, I was very hesitant and scared to go to a foreign country all by myself, because I’ve never gone on a solo trip in India, let alone outside the country. So, I asked my friends and they suggested that I travel to Vietnam. In fact, I was very scared on the first day I arrived here, but now, I'm in love with this place and the people here,” says the actress.
‘Yes, I looked for indian restaurants...’
Though Anupama is loving every bit of her travel to Vietnam, the actress is longing for homemade food. “I went around looking for Indian restaurants, but didn’t find any. I’m already missing home-cooked food. Having said that, I am trying out the local fare here. I have tried egg noodles, fried rice and more so far,” she says.

‘Explore, experience...’
The trip, says Anupama, is all about being spontaneous and trying new things. “It was the first time that I didn’t chalk out an elaborate plan for my travel and didn’t book any hotel. In fact, I stayed in a hostel and had to share my room with others. This is something I’ve done for the first time. I cannot share my room with anyone and I did that. Speaking of firsts, I also hired a bike and went to explore the city. I’ve never done that in Bengaluru,” says Anupama, who also tried the egg coffee and tried her hand at karate for the first time ever. “Even though I enjoy coffee in general, I didn’t particularly enjoy egg coffee. I realised it’s not for me,” she sums up.

‘I tried these here for the first time ever...’
Egg coffee
Stayed in a hostel and shared a room
Took a solo bike ride and explored the city
Sat on a railway track and took a picture
‘While on a solo trip, you must remember to...’
Anupama says that reading a bit before going on a trip always makes travelling to that particular place easier. a few tips that she shared...

- Read and understand how the currency exchange works

- Try the local cuisine as much as possible

- Do not fall for sales or discounts at branded stores. It is actually expensive when you convert the currency and buy in a foreign country

- Try to buy locally-produced items and artifacts, which are not available in your country

- It is safer to try the usual tours"

Talking about the movie, which marks his debut as a hero, Manju says, “While I have acted in character roles before, this is my first outing as the leading man. It will see me and Chikkanna back together on screen, again. I play Bharatha and he essays the character of Baahubali.” The cast and crew share that when Manju approached them and said that he would be playing the lead, they were all quite quizzical about the decision. Music director Manikanth Kadri says, “I knew that Manju is multi-talented. I am aware of his prowess as a writer, director and lyricist — he has also sung a song in the film. He is such a cool person to work with. But, when he told me that he was playing the lead, I was initially wondering how he would pull off the role.” Chikkanna chips in, “When Manju narrated the script to me, I too asked him if he was sure about taking on the lead role. However, after working with him in this movie and having seen the final output, I now know that he fits the part really well. He has also worked really hard to shed oodles of weight and become fitter for this role.” The event saw Sarah Harish, Shreya Shetty, Srinivas Murthy, Prakhyath Paramesh and Kari Subbu, among others in attendance."
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,"I talk to myself constantly, to reinforce that I am capable and can achieve, yet again: Pankaj Advani","Bengaluru-based cueist Pankaj Advani, the 23-time World Champion, is charged up for yet another year filled with tournaments at which he hopes to do what he does each year — win. The only record he beats each year is his own. This year, however, is also about imparting knowledge as Pankaj has initiated a connect with schools in Bengaluru where students can learn the nuances of the sport with him. While they say it gets lonely at the top, there have been rumours of cupid having struck here, which the sportsman insists on guarding. “Will let you know, in good time,” is all he says. Over to Pankaj…
What about 2020 is most exciting for you right now?
It is the beginning of the new year and there are a lot of tournaments lined up as usual, which begins with the National Championships in April. The mid-year will see the Asian Championships, which will be followed by the World Championships. Besides this, I have two things in mind for billiards and snooker.

One is for the sport to be televised, which our federation ought to look in to. A professional league, that is televised, will not only attract viewers, but will also provide more visibility to aspiring cueists. The other, is what I can do in my own capacity through my initiative, Cue Schools by Pankaj Advani. Through this, we hope to be able to take the game to schools. I want to give aspiring cueists a platform to pursue their talent in this sport.
How feasible is it to have a televised professional league?
As a player, I can talk about what I expect for the sport. It is the federation, the administrators, and the people who are in-charge of popularising the sport who should answer this question. All I can say that there was such a league in place back in 2017, and it was televised. I am not sure what happened to it. But it has not been so for the past two years

You have been inclined towards working with new talent, children mostly. What is the plan behind that?
It is very heartening to see the passion with which kids have picked up cue sport. Some of them have immense talent. Few of them also participated in the state ranking events. The whole idea behind my initiative to reach out to school children is to provide a platform for young, aspiring players to hone their skills and to create future champions by developing the grass root level.

On the international front, you have been beating your own records each year. Do you have any quirks or mantras that you follow to motivate yourself before participating in every championship?
The hunger to achieve is very important, as is the belief in yourself. You have to constantly remind yourself, that you are the player who won the last time around, and that you need to be better than that. One only sees the achievements and the titles at the end of the day, but the process to get there takes a lot out of you — both emotionally and physically. A sportsperson’s career goes through loads of ups and downs, it is never smooth. In that sense, I feel I am a constant work in progress. One cannot always be at one’s peak, because there are always other factors in life that change and, therefore, affect the way one performs at a match. It is not easy to maintain the same levels of energy and intensity. I talk to myself constantly, sometimes in front of the mirror and sometimes when I am alone. I remind myself that I have done it in the past, and reinforce the belief that I am still capable of doing it — yet again, any day and anytime. Before playing a major tournament, I tend to get into a shell, I don’t talk much to people. It is even more so when I am travelling. I limit myself to reading on my own during these competitions. My family and closest friends understand my need to be by myself before a tournament and let me be too.


As someone who has excelled in individual sports like billiards and snooker, how do you feel you may have fared in team sport?

The dynamics of team sport is very different when compared to that of individual sport. In an individual sport, you’re completely in charge of your performance. If you win, you take all the credit. If you lose, you take all the blame for the loss. It is good in a way, because you do not have any external factor to blame or comment on. It is just you and your performance in the arena. In team sports, it is not just your performance, but also the relationship with your teammates, among other things, that tend to matter. There are times when players within the team end up trying to compete against each other. That, thankfully, is not something I need to deal with.

Team members are also subjected to the ‘selection’ process, in which one is at the mercy of the selectors. In individual sport, all you need to do is play well, and you are soon in the top line-up of the country’s players and you are representing India. As long as you are playing well, nobody is going to stop you. This is what I’ve been used to and cannot think of anything else.


Do you dabble in any other sport?

Well, I’m only good at one and I’d rather let it be that way (laughs). Though, I love watching tennis and I am eagerly waiting for the Australian Open to see if the big three (Djokovic, Nadal and Federer) can still reign supreme or will the gen next take over."
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,The element of mass is in the story and not in the artistes: Manikandan,"Manikandan believes in walking the talk. The director is making a film on farmers and their way of life, and to put into practice what he hopes to convey to his audiences, he’s bought his own piece of land and started farming. “I don’t like to preach or shove down messages down their throat. But luckily for me, they grasp what I want to imply through a film. After watching Kaaka Muttai, they didn’t conclude that eating pizza was wrong. They understood that we don’t have to be heavily influenced by others and find happiness with what we have. They started debating if giving a punishment as severe as the crime was important after watching Kuttrame Thandanai and questioned who they ought to be faithful to —the work and the company or those who are dependent on the work and his own social morale — after Aandavan Kattalai. And after watching Kadaisi Vivasayi, I hope they will feel encouraged to do farming,” says Manikandan, “When I chose to do this film, someone advised me that I should actually do farming to understand the whole process. So, I bought land in my town, Usilampatti, and also in Vandhavasi, and started cultivating there. We are doing organic farming and the rice that we consume at home comes from there.”
It’s been over three years since Manikandan had a release. What took him so long to come out with this one? “For every film, I make it a point to visit the place where the story is set and interact with people. For Kaaka Muttai, I spent six months in the slums. For Aandavan Kattalai, I met people who’ve lost their passports and have been cheated by agents who promised them work abroad. It took me a little over two months because the person who had written the story had already done in-depth research. So, when I decided to do a film on farming, I wanted to meet people who are actually involved in it,” he says.

Manikandan visited over 100 villages to check out locations and that took him over a year. “I had also selected all my artistes from those villages. If the film was set in Chennai, I could have just called for an audition. But in these villages, I’d to convince them to come and act. They are already working — someone is involved in farming, sila peru aadu, maadu meikkaranga. So, it took a lot of convincing from my side. I shifted my office to Usilampatti, near my hometown, Vilampatti. Also, the story captures each stage of farming. So, vedhai vedhaikkaradhe romba naal shoot panninom. I couldn’t have skipped any process and that took me 95 days of shooting. Thotta Tharani sir had put up a set of a sub-jail in the village, away from the noise of traffic, because we were shooting using sync sound and the ambience was very important. To top it all, it was my own production and sourcing money took time,” he says.
Working with real villagers was an experience he’d cherish for a long time, the director says. “These people came to act not because they would be seen on the big screen. Innaru peran padam panraan, adhula namma iruppom — appidingara orey karanathukkaga nadikka vandhanga,” he says with a smile, “These people are not aware of the structure of cinema. On the first day, they thought I was going to take photos of them and just stood rigid. I then explained how they could walk and talk and that would be captured and only then did they move around. I can’t treat them like how I’d treat professional artistes. Manasu nogara maadhiri edhavadhu sonna, adutha naal varamaatanga. Those who act as villagers in movies are villagers who’ve come to Chennai to become actors. These people have no such interest.”

In fact, the film’s hero is an 86-year-old farmer, Nallandi. “He had no prior experience in acting and I couldn’t have just given him dialogues and expected him to deliver. One day, we were going to shoot a scene in which he had to make a Ganesha idol out of clay. We’d already set the frame, but while going for the take, he refused to do it because it was not eesani moolai! So, I had to completely change the track,” he says with a laugh.


“Likewise, I had to wait for villagers to choose an auspicious day and time to sow the seeds to film that because, for them, this is real. They are sowing the seed for real and will cultivate crops for real. I can’t force them to do it my way. Even for those who formed the atmosphere, I had to explain the full scene or else, they would walk around like dolls, flat and emotionless. So, I used to tell them, ‘you two are going to a shop’ and ‘you two are talking about household problems’. I’ve given money to two villagers and asked them to buy tea, sit down on the bench, talk for some time, keep the glass down and then, take their cycles and go back home!” he adds.


Of late, filmmakers are opting to portray stories of older adults on screen. Does he think audiences today are okay with not seeing a ‘hero’ doing massy stuff? “The element of mass is in the story, not in the artistes or their age. If the mass element is present in a scene, it will reflect on screen, irrespective of who does it. And if the element is missing in the scene, it won’t work out, even if it’s performed by a big hero,” he points out, “I don’t think age is a criterion.”


The filmmaker has roped in Vijay Sethupathi and Yogi Babu to play important roles in Kadaisi Vivasayi. “These were characters not written for them, but I’m glad they agreed to play them. If a popular actor performs a certain role in a film, the reach is much better. Vijay Sethupathi plays a devotee of Lord Muruga who walks to all the temples, and Yogi Babu plays a man who’s sold his 15-acre farmland and bought an elephant instead. If any other actor had done these roles, it would have still been received by the audience. But, the magnitude of the reach will be higher now because they are well-established actors,” he says.


Hasn’t it become fashionable to include a ‘farmer’ angle in films these days? “If you include an angle that has no relation to the story, then it makes no sense. We all know the problems farmers face are a reality. So, there’s no point saying it again. Instead, we should probably talk about why such problems arise and what could be a possible solution. In my film, we are talking about who a farmer is and why is he in such a state. But I’m not looking at the camera and saying that in as many words because film is not a medium for that. It’s not a docu-fiction or a documentary, and neither am I a journalist. My responsibility is to narrate a story, and I’m just doing that,” he says with conviction."

,"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Entertainment,Nivin Pauly: Being part of films such as Moothon add value to you as an actor,"Last year might not have started out with a bang for Nivin Pauly, but he made sure he ended 2019 on a high – raking in rave reviews for his performance as the tormented Akbar in Moothon and showing that he can still work his magic in the box office with his indolent youth avatar in Love Action Drama. The star talks about the work he put in for his terrific performance in Geetu Mohandas’ Moothon, what its reception means to him and what to look forward to in 2020.
You have had several superhits in your career including Premam and Thattathin Marayathu. Compared to those, how important was Moothon’s reception to you?

I am immensely satisfied with how Moothon has been received. It’s something that I have put in a lot of effort; but ultimately what matters is that audience has to like what I have done and in Moothon that happened. When you are part of commercial cinema, you rarely get such offers to be part of films that get a good run in the festival circuit too and importantly adds so much value to you as an actor. I am just lucky that I could do that in 2019 and I am even more glad that Moothon has been appreciated far and wide.


Considering Mikhael’s lacklustre box office performance early last year, did that put extra pressure on you while doing a film like Moothon that had you in a role well outside your comfort zone?
I have never believed in taking pressure. I don’t think you can work well under stress. I pick movies based on my intuition and preference; some movies work, some don’t, and I am fine with that. What matters to me is that I stay happy and try to do good work. Last year, also had Love Action Drama that did well in the box office. People liked its humour and Moothon was entirely different. So, frankly, I consider it a good thing that I could be part of two films that were on two extreme ends of the spectrum.


The lessons you learn also vary with the director you work with. Geetu is someone who demands performance from you; she’s not going to let you off the hook so easily. She knows specifically what she wants and gives enough reasoning to exact that out of you. And when a director pushes you, saying that you can do even better, it also spurs you on in a way and gives you that extra bit of confidence as a performer. I think only when you work with such directors, you get to take it up a notch. They make you explore layers that you have never done before. Actors don’t get to do that every time.

Apart from Prithviraj in Mumbai Police, an established star has not play a homosexual character in Malayalam films, till you did in Moothon. Were you apprehensive about how it would turn out?

Many said that there would be different kinds of response when the movie releases, and I had to be ready to face it. But all the feedback has been positive. Majority appreciated me for the brave attempt. Initially too, I had no qualms taking up the role. My only concern was if I could convincingly pull of the character. I think all actors have that fear, irrespective of what character they pick.

Your romantic scenes with Roshan Mathew, who played a mute homosexual, was one of the several highpoints of the movie. And to pull those off, all the actors should have equally been at ease?

We were comfortable with each other. He’s a friend too. Both of us were given separate briefings by the director, and these scenes were not rehearsed. We had the freedom to do what we thought made the scene better. Geetu’s only demand was that it had to be spontaneous and to the point. Between co-actors it’s always a process of act and react. Also, almost all the scenes in the movie required spontaneity. We had an acting workshop, but even though we had rehearsed some of the scenes, when it came to performing on the location, we had the freedom to improvise.


After going through the emotional turmoil of Akbar in Moothon, Love Action Drama must have provided ample opportunities to de-stress.

Of course. It was totally fun and because the subject had a lot of humour, we didn’t have to get into a shell and internalise. We had to enjoy working in the film for it to work. And fortunately, the result was evident in theatres.


Amid all the preparations for your characters, did you strike a balance between work and family last year?

I like to think I could spend enough time with them. I could plan my breaks so that I could maintain that balance, which I think is important. Also, we spent Christmas and New Year together.


What can the audience expect from you in 2020?

I think it will be a mixed bag like 2019. My first release will be Rajeev Ravi’s Thuramukham; it’s a period film set in the 30s and 40s. I am currently shooting for Padavettu. I am also in discussions for a few interesting projects and will be working with a couple of debutant filmmakers. I am hoping I can be part of really good movies this year too."
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,Shilpa Ravi will be seen as Madhumitha in her next TV serial Jeeva Hoovagide,"TV actress Shilpa Ravi, who was last seen in the serial Manasa Sarovara, is now back in a new soap opera, titled Jeeva Hoovagide. Produced by actor Raghavendra Rajkumar, the serial is directed by Sunil and features Ajay and Aryan Surya in lead roles. “My affiliation with the Rajkumar family has continued with Jeeva Hoovagide. My last serial was produced by Shivarajkumar. It’s a coincidence that I got the opportunity to work under the prestigious banner,” says Shilpa.

Giving a sneak peek of her character in the serial, the actress says, “I play the role of a well-educated girl, named Madhumitha, who after completing her studies in the city returns to her native village. There she falls in love with a guy from a rival family. How Madhumitha takes the relationship to the next level forms the crux of the story. There are plenty of twists and turns in the story to keep the viewers engrossed.”

Shilpa had made her small-screen debut in Tamil. “I first got the offer from the Tamil industry, but being a Kannada girl, I always wanted to act here. And, I first acted in Ammanavru, and then went on to portray the character of a villain in Naagini, followed by another role of an antagonist in the Tamil serial, Arundathi,” she explains.

“It doesn’t matter to me whether it is a positive or a negative character. because I think there is always room for creativity when essaying the character of a villain, which is often not the case in positive roles,” she signs off."

The filmmaker, who has produced films like City Of Gold (2010), Haunted 3D (2011), spoke to BT about working with Ajay Devgn in the magnum opus and making a film that’s mounted on a huge canvas. Excerpts:
What drew you to make your first Hindi film on Tanhaji Malusare?
In 2007, when I was studying in the US, I saw Zack Snyder’s 300 (2007). I was completely mesmerised by it. Until that day, I didn’t know who Leonidas (King of Sparta, played by Gerard Butler) was. When I stepped out of the theatre, I wondered why we don’t make such films. We have so many interesting historical characters and their stories deserve to be told. The first personality that came to my mind was Subedar Tanhaji Malusare.


You thought about making the film in 2007, while it is releasing in 2020. That’s quite a long wait... I wanted to make Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior before my first directorial, but I couldn’t get Ajay Devgn at that point of time. I was sure that I wanted to make this film with him. So, after my first Marathi film, I began working on it. That year, Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) released and it gave me the confidence that we, too, can make films on such a huge scale.

You were keen that Ajay plays this role. How confident were you that he would agree to do the film?
When I met him, I just had 30 minutes to narrate the idea. After hearing the first half of the story, he asked me, ‘How will you be able to make this film?’ I didn’t quite understand his question. He explained, ‘Who is going to pay for it?’ I was clueless. That’s when he said that he would produce it. That was great news for me. I offered to narrate the other half, but he didn’t even go through the second half that day, which showed his confidence in me. He was convinced on hearing just the first half of the script.

Did you expect the film to be mounted on such a big scale and feature actors like Saif Ali Khan and Kajol?
Working with Ajay Devgn was very easy. I believe that our styles are very similar. I couldn’t have thought of Saif as Udaybhan Rathod. I approached every actor other than him. Interestingly, not a single actor said no to the role, but I would develop cold feet and then back out from finalising them. One day, Ajay called me and asked me where the villain was. We were fast approaching the time when we would have to start shooting for the film. It was during the meeting with him that we discussed Saif. Ajay contacted Saif, and two hours later, I was in Saif’s office, and soon enough, he was on board. As for Kajol, when I was thinking of casting for the role of Savitribai (Tanhaji’s wife), she did come to my mind. I asked Ajay about it, and he said, ‘Tu Kajol ko bolke dekh phir dekhte hai kya hota hai.’ It is a small role but has a lot of depth.

After the trailer released, Saif’s look as Udaybhan was compared to Ranveer Singh’s look as Alauddin Khilji in Padmaavat (2018)…

I wrote the character much before I had seen Padmaavat. I believe that there could be parallels drawn, but I don’t think there are any similarities between the two. What Ranveer and Sanjay sir (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) had done in Padmaavat is different. In fact, Udaybhan is louder.


Legend has it, Tanhaji brought along his pet ghorpad (monitor lizard) that could cling to rocks. A rope was tied around the lizard and it was made to climb up the cliff, paving the way for the soldiers to climb holding them. Is that depicted in the film? Also, what went into the research to make this film, which is based on the Battle of Sinhagad?

The reference of a ghorpad came from a powada (ballad) written in 1839, by an unknown author. This incident happened in 1670, while 1830 is the backdrop of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. At that time, artistes were creating awareness about the freedom struggle. I think that Indians believe in animism. According to me, that is where the domesticated monitor lizard comes in. However, we did take some cinematic liberties in the film, in order to satisfy both the sides. This is a historical film, and someone or the other will react or oppose it. As far as the research is concerned, we read various books and referred to other material that was available to us. However, for inferences like these, you have to create, derive, get inspired and bend the narrative in other ways. While making a historical, you have to make sure that you do not tarnish or distort anything. You have to maintain the sanctity of the characters.


Your first film was based on Bal Gangadhar Tilak, while your second is about Tanhaji Malusare. Which personality from the pages of our history do you plan to focus on next?

I am done with the historical genre for now. No more shooting with swords and shields for me (laughs!). My next Hindi film is of a different genre. I will start working on it soon."
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 01:00 IST",Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,TV,Delnaaz Irani: Would love to play a plus-size naagin,"From playing the role of Sweetu, a simple girl who’s constantly being fat-shamed by her family and friends in 'Kal Ho Na Ho' to being a popular television actress having starred in several shows, including 'Bigg Boss' Season 6 and 'Batliwalla House No 49', Delnaaz Irani is a household name in the showbiz industry. The actress, who is currently busy doing theatre, was recently in the city to perform in her latest show, 'Tera Kya Hoga Walia', talks about why she would love to play a healthy naagin on TV, her relationship with her beau DJ Percy, and more.

‘I haven’t got my due yet in the showbiz industry yet’

Delnaaz, who has been doing theatre for over a year, now wants to make a comeback on TV. “I am looking for a show worth my while. I feel as an actor, I have not got my due in the industry. I have done the biggest reality shows, quite a few films, and some good TV shows, but I feel I have not really got the positioning I need in the industry. I don’t know why people have typecast me as someone who is gori chitti, thodi si moti and someone who can only do comedy. I want to tell those people that I can do much more.”


‘Naagins and bichchus will continue to rule the small screen’
When asked about the kind of roles she would like to do in 2020, the actress says, “I would love to see myself in a completely different avatar. I would like to play a plus-size, healthy naagin in 2020.” So, is she okay to play a supernatural character? Delnaaz says, “If the show is getting the TRPs, then why not? As an artiste, I don’t want to blame the channel or the producer. People crib about shows like 'Bigg Boss' but it ends with the highest TRPs. The whole genre of naagins and bichchus will continue to rule the screen if the audience keeps consuming them. I feel if you give them feel-good shows or present historical shows in a different format, people will appreciate them.”
Delnaaz, who is dating DJ Percy, says marriage is not on her mind right now

‘Percy and I are in a live-in relationship, marriage is not on the cards’
Delnaaz may have found her Mr Right in DJ Percy Karkaria but marriage is not on her mind. She says, “We are in a very happy space right now. We are in a live-in relationship, and we like it this way. Marriage is not my mind right now, but as they say, never say never. We are as good as a married couple. Percy had a bitter divorce and so did I, and I think we have had our share of marriage and then divorce, so we both come together as good friends, soulmates who are there for one another. It is a lovely bond that we share.” Percy, who is a professional DJ, has influenced Delnaaz’s music choices, and vice-versa, as she tells us, “His choice of music is very different from mine. I love ‘70s and ‘80s retro hits, especially Kishore Kumar, RD Burman’s. He has started loving all of them because of me. He is more into EDM and contemporary beats. Earlier whenever we would go out, we would have a tiff over the kind of music we would play, but now, we have started enjoying both peppy beats and retro numbers.”"
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Ankit Siwach to tie the knot with girlfriend Nupur Bhatia on February 4,"They first met at an age when they had not even heard words like ‘love’ and ‘soulmates’. As the years went by, they became the best of friends, fighting against many odds and supporting each other through thick and thin. And now, Ankit Siwach and Nupur Bhatia are all set for another milestone in their relationship.
Ankit, who was last seen as the male lead in the TV show, Manmohini, will tie the knot with Nupur, senior marketing manager at a multinational company, on February 4. The actor tells BT, “The marriage and pre-wedding rituals will be a close-knit affair, and they will be held at a resort in Uttarakhand. I have to plan a reception for my friends in Mumbai and a party in my hometown, Meerut, too.”

Talking about his ladylove, he says, “Nupur and I have been classmates since kindergarten and friends for almost 20 years now. In our case, the dialogue, ‘Pyaar dosti hai’ (from the 1998 Bollywood hit, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai) is true. We have already spent almost a lifetime together, witnessed the highs and lows with changing circumstances, and accepted each other the way we are. There were times when we were in different cities, even different countries for some time, but we stood by each other through everything.

We have come a long way and I am happy that this beautiful relationship is culminating in marriage. I am both nervous and excited to take this step with Nupur.”

Like any other relationship, theirs, too, has weathered the test of time and come out stronger. Ankit shares, “There was a time when, as individuals, we went through major changes because of our professions. The way we looked at life was totally different; our approaches were poles apart. I believe everyone hits that low phase in life, which gradually passes, and it all depends on how you emerge out of it. Looking back, I think that the turmoils we faced have helped our relationship become stronger.”


Ask Ankit if the fact that he is in a profession full of uncertainties has ever caused any insecurity in their relationship, and he replies, “I have always got my space, even before I joined the industry. Having said that, lifestyle changes and entering a new, unknown space (industry) did affect me. Initially, my insecurities as an actor, and the battle to prove myself created a bubble around me. I could not feel anything except my desire to be an actor; I was very vulnerable. But thankfully, Nupur and I survived that phase, too, and we have both come to the conclusion that acceptance is the only solution. Accept life the way it is — good or bad. What matters is that it should be taken care of, together.”"
"Created: Jan 6, 2020, 01:00 IST",Riya Sharma,Lifestyle,"Conscious, ethical, vegan and chemical-free: Your guide to sustainable skincare products","When it comes to skincare or hair products, often it’s what’s inside it that counts. If you want to go the sustainable way and clean up your act, we have some handy tips for you
Clean beauty was probably the biggest celebrity trend of 2019. It refers to products that are mindfully created and don’t have toxic chemicals. They have ingredients ethically sourced and are made with keeping our bodily health and the environment in mind. With celebrities like Kourtney Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow regaling fans with benefits of clean beauty, it has also become synonymous with luxury and expensive products. However, that is not necessarily true. As people increasingly ask ‘what is it made up of?’ instead of ‘what will look good on me?’ many homegrown clean beauty brands are providing sustainable alternatives to chemical-laden skincare products from big brands. And if you don’t have access to them or don’t want to spend money on skincare products, ghar ke nuskhe using household ingredients is the best way to protect your skin and the environment.

When you buy a skincare product, go through the list of ingredients
If you wish to switch to sustainable skincare products but have no idea what to look for in a product, here is a simple advice: “A product’s packaging is an indication of the company’s position vis-a-vis environment sustainability. But it may not be enough. The more natural the ingredients are, the more reliable it can be in terms of having a lower ecological impact. Hence, going through the list of ingredients is important if you want to be environmentally conscious,” suggests Shireen Saxena from Ghaziabad, co-founder of Vedic Tattva, a natural and organic personal care range.
She adds, “One should also be wary of purchasing such products from large corporations that mass-produce everything as they leave behind a significant carbon footprint in the process. Instead, look for small businesses that offer handcrafted options and use fresher, superior and more natural ingredients.”



There are also many DIY experts online who can help you make your own soaps, shampoos, face packs and creams if you have the time and dedication. “In India, people hardly read the ingredients, that is why we try to educate them through our stalls. Educating people about the products they are using is very important. Alternatively, you can also make your own products so that you know what you are putting on your skin,” says Kavita Surana, a resident of Mumbai and co-founder of Iktara, an eco-friendly products range.

Shireen says that people are becoming more conscious and have started paying attention to what they are using and spending their money on. “People are becoming more conscious about not just what they eat, but also what they use on themselves. Health, wellness, personal care, sustainability are all interlinked and being conscientious in one would most likely propel you towards the rest,” she tells us.


Sustainable products are cruelty-free, good for the environment
Industry experts say that the trend towards ethical consumerism grew almost 40% in the last year itself. Focussing on the rise of vegan skincare products in India, Madhavi Irani, Chief Officer, Content, Nykaa.com, shares, “In India, too, there is a growing trend towards vegan products by thoughtful consumers who go beyond ‘what’s good for me’ to ‘what’s gone into making the product’.” She adds, “While the Indian cosmetic market has an average growth rate of about 17% each year, the cruelty-free, vegan cosmetics market is set to grow by 6.1% from 2017 - 2023, with India being one of the top exporters of these cosmetics. Most vegan brands do not contain parabens, sulfates and other common cosmetic ingredients that have harmful effects on both the environment and the user.”

Vegan products, as the name suggests, are made purely from plant extracts, mostly essential oils and have a healing and soothing impact on the mind and body. They are not tested on animals so vegan products are cruelty-free as well. “Most market-dominating skincare products are synthetic chemicals, during the production of which waste by-products are generated. These ultimately wash down into nature and impede in the sustainability of the environment. In addition, their packaging usually contains non-biodegradable material and their production is energy and water intensive,” says Vinai Saxena, Chairman, KVIC (Khadi and Village Industries Commission), adding, “Some products that can be used naturally like aloe vera, turmeric, cucumber, some oils etc, strangely come back to society in a packaged form in a mix of chemicals that could prove to be environmentally hazardous in the long run.Therefore, replacing synthetic products with natural produce is important.”

Talking about khadi products, Vinai says, “The basic premise of khadi skin care products is that they are extracts of naturally occurring plant-based material like roots, leaves, fruits or nuts. Even the medium in which the extracts are preserved and presented are predominantly natural and no chemicals are added. Most importantly, khadi-based production process does not release environmentally harmful by-products, waste water, effluents or emissions.”


Do It Yourself
Roshni Kapoor, a resident of Saket, says, “I survive on bare minimum in terms of buying skincare products from the market. I make my own face packs with besan at home. I look for organic and natural products which are delivered to me in packing material which can be recycled or reused.”
Rohini Juneja, a resident of Bangalore who makes handmade soaps, shares some tips to make your own skincare products

Eggs are great for hair

Turmeric with green gram flour or besan can be used as a body cleanser, and exfoliator.

Potatoes can be used if you have burnt your skin from sun’s exposure.

Honey is an excellent addition for face and hair masks.

You can also make great hair gel at home by just boiling flax seeds in water."

Kumaresh: You have been playing for over 50 years now. What does music mean to you?
Ganesh: We are all talking right now to express something, right? Well, I don’t do that. I express through music. When I play music, I feel something is talking to me. But I don’t know if others will understand it in the same way. I feel it’s a language. When I play a raga, I will play it like a story. It is my way of expressing something. When we express something through words, I feel we miss out on a lot as it could be lost in translation. We lose out on that emotion. We’ve been playing together for so many years now and there have been times when we both want to try the same sangathi at that particular moment. I would want to communicate that to you (looks at Kumaresh) and you would have picked up that sangathi without even me having to explain it to you through words. (looks at us) He is that fast!


Kumaresh: I have learnt a lot from anna. When we are playing together, he will expect me to be there before he finishes one sangathi. I have to be sharp. If I don't, he will get angry. Ganesh: Ellarum enna shantha swaroobi-nu enachindu irrupa...

Kumaresh: Kovam kuda oru improvisation la kattuvar (laughs).
Ganesh: Ok, I have question for you. When you play, there is a lot of rhythmic energy. Do you apply the same when you play the aalap as well?
Kumaresh: I don’t think like that. Even when I was young, I didn’t plan anything and just went with the flow. I like rhythm and have learnt the mridangam. But somehow, I stuck to violin. You can play everything in violin. Anna will say layam is not just about rhythmic patterns, but it is the mesmerising factor. Music complements layam and vice versa. When we play ragam, we gradually build the raga and pep it up from the pace where we started. We slow down if it becomes fast. All these are rhythmic expressions. But I haven’t thought of these like that… I don’t have an analytical mind; I have an experienced mind. Knowledge is not for me; experience is for me (laughs).

Kumaresh: You’ve been performing for decades now. Has your enthusiasm remained the same since then?
Ganesh: Well, the energy is different, but the enthusiasm is still intact. At that time, it was more to do with what we have learnt and doing it properly. I used to have so many things on my mind and it was restricted just in my thoughts. Today, it is not like that. I can play whatever I want as I know I have a command over it. Initially, I used to be enthusiastic about music, and now, music gives me that enthusiasm.

Ganesh: So, who have been your inspirations?
Kumaresh: I have many inspirations. But there is a thin line between inspiration and influence. So many people like Lalgudi Jayaraman mama, MS Gopalakrishnan mama, Vikku Vinayakram mama, Zakir Hussain bhai and you have inspired me. I like one thing about each person… like Lalgudi mama’s soul, MSG mama’s control over the instrument and Zakir bhai’s flamboyance. But only when you move closer with that person do you know what kind of personality he is. Vinayakaram mama na… upapakkavathiyam-nu solra ghatam-a he brought it to limelight. So, each of them have inspired me in many ways. Today, I am my own inspiration as certain things I do inspire me and makes me go ‘wow’. It is not arrogance, it is not ego, but a self-belief that I can do anything. There are no limits as they are only in your mind. Playing with anna is not easy at all. I think I can do it, which is why I am able to do it. So, we need to have that self-belief. So, I inspire myself now.
Kumaresh: In all sabhas, we have photos of saints Tyagaraja, Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar. Don’t you think it’s about time they have photos of TNR (Thirumarugal Natesapillai Rajarathinam Pillai), Balamuralikrishna mama, Madurai Mani Iyer, Palakkad Mani Iyer and other giants from the 19th century?

Ganesh: Enna maativittutta... (laughs)
Kumaresh: It is just an observation…
Ganesh: We should have their photos. But we have huge respect for saints, and all those musicians have earned that. They are not just singers or instrumentalist, they are naada yogis. Naada bindu kaladi namo namaha solluvom la… they have gone into the vibration of sound and found it. Athma dhyanam kadaicha gnyani ava. To have their photos in the sabhas is only fair. But the pictures of the great musicians you mentioned should be present in books. Musicians or music connoisseurs would obviously know these stalwarts, but the general public must also be aware of these greatest musicians of the Carnatic world. If I ask any kid if they know S Balachander, they would ask if it is KB (director K Balachander) sir. Take for instance TNR mama (TN Rajarathnam Pillai); there are so many interesting stories about him. Rasikas used to say how he would be lost to the world when he plays the nadaswaram. We should pass such anecdotes to the next generation. They should be celebrated, too. We all know Michael Jackson, but how many of us know our own giants?


Kumaresh: Ok, let’s talk about Ragapravaham. We have been doing it for over 25 years – how’s the journey?

Ganesh: To begin with, Ragapravaham is an important tool to express yourself as a musician. Unfortunately, in Carnatic music, ellame paadra maathiriye vasikkanum-nu oru tradition vandhuduthu. It wasn’t the case earlier. Music was born because of instruments. God and Goddesses like Saraswati and Krishna had veena and flute. Gods played instrumental music. So, who sings? We, devotees, sing. Gods play instruments and devotees sing in praise of them. Instrumentalists should think musically. Ragapravaham is expressing oneself as a musician in that form. We have adopted compositions in such a way that it has no lyrics, but have ragam, rhythm and thalam. When I play something, you don’t have to feel what I feel, as you have the freedom to interpret it the way you want. That is the beauty of music. I’m sure people would then ask, ‘how will everyone learn music?’ We are creating a completely new syllabus for violin where it doesn’t involve lyrics at all. We teach ragam, gamakam and all other aspects of music and violin play, so that children don’t have the burden of learning the lyrics.


Kumaresh: Someone who doesn’t know Telugu learns Telugu songs. The bhavam will be different for him when he sings a Telugu song as opposed to when he sings a song in his mother tongue. This becomes difficult especially for kids. You are killing their enthusiasm. So, we teach them to play with the sound and when we give these melodies, they love it. We never asked musicians from the previous generation what their idea of music is. What we are doing now is an interpretation of music. When a critic interprets my music, it will be based on what he knows. But my experience is different. Usually, in the West, critics would have also studied music and he’d know everything about, say, Beethoven’s compositions. Here, many have learnt the words. For instance, if I play music in a different way or I want to add a sangathi to a keerthanai, critics wonder why. It limits the art form.


Ganesh: In the late 70s, there used to be at least four instrumental concerts among the 10 that a sabha organises. Today, after slotting all the 10 concerts, they think of including an instrumental performance. Some try to bring all the instrumentalists together and have an ensemble concert. It loses its significance that way. However, Ragapravaham will be the future of music. If there’s a duet concert, both the artistes end up sounding the same. Kumaresh and I want to play together, but we don’t want to sound like one. Instead, we want to complement each other."
"Created: Jan 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,"Can express ourselves better in Kannada, say Bengaluru student rappers","Music, it is said, helps people express themselves; even more so when it is in your mother tongue. At a time when youngsters are often chided for following all things Western, it comes as a pleasant surprise that an increasing number of young student artistes in Bengaluru are opting to express themselves in their mother tongue, especially Kannada. So much so that even rap, which has been thought to be only for the English-speaking crowd, is getting a desi twist, with many rappers showcasing their prowess with numbers in Kannada. What’s more is that the medium is also being used by these artistes to express their thoughts on life, social causes and so much more, making rapping more than just singing.
Rapping in Kannada, to stay true to roots
“I rap in both Kannada and English, but since my mother tongue is Kannada, expressing my thoughts sometimes comes easier to me in it. I believe that rapping in Kannada allows me to express myself better. I follow Eminem and I used to rap predominantly in English, but then I realised that I can do it a lot better in Kannada and so, I began performing in both the languages,” says Nitin Savio, a student from St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous)


Kevin Lourd, a first-year student from NITTE Meenakshi Institute of Technology, who prefers to rap in Kannada and Tamil, echoes this and adds, “Rapping is all about the artiste, where he/she comes from and his/her roots. As a rapper, I believe it is important to stick to your roots. That way, not only is your story authentic, but it also helps you express better.”
Ensures originality of compositions
“Kannada is a very powerful language and the best way to showcase our culture is through music, especially if it’s performed in in our mother tongue,” says Shivakumar, a student of Government Ramnarayan Chellaram College of Commerce and Management. Rapping in a vernacular language, he adds, also means that extra effort is put into the quality and originality of the compositions. “Considering that this is our effort in doing our bit for a performing art in Kannada, the focus has been on quality of work. We spend time on writing the lyrics and don’t do rush jobs, so that we can make a substantial contribution to the Kannada rap scene in the city,” he says.

Students who don’t know Kannada try to understand the lyrics
The beauty of rap, says Shivakumar, is that it is a good way to introduce other students to Kannada. “Rap, as an art, is such that the beats and the rhythm attract listeners. So, when we perform in Kannada, not only do they enjoy the music, but also try to understand the lyrics. Performing in Kannada is our way of taking the language to greater heights,” he says.

Performing in Kannada and getting an audience is a lot of hard work, though, adds Nitin. “Normally, we start off with some popular numbers to set the tone. Once we know for sure that the audience is paying attention, we introduce them to our original compositions, which are songs about us, our city and culture,” says Nitin. Kevin adds, “If we are not original and don’t connect with what we sing, there is no way that the audience will connect with us. I’m an 18 year old, rapping about what someone my age goes through, the struggles and more. But that can change depending on the audience.”

‘Know the language and be original’

Kannada rapper All.OK is very impressed with the trend of youngsters taking up the art form, and that too in Kannada. But he has a word of advice for aspiring rappers. “Originality is the key to make a mark. Do not copy other rappers and create your own style. If you are serious about taking it up professionally, you need to have a strong understanding of the language that you choose to perform in. This helps with the word flow, as rapping is about putting rhyming words out there in a rhythm,” he says.

It looks like the actor, who was in the news for the wrong reasons during the latter half of 2019, has decided to make the right noises this time around and has gotten himself busy with work this year. While work on the revival of his Maanaadu with Venkat Prabhu is underway, STR will be releasing a single, which he has composed, written and sung, this February.

The song, a source tells us, will be on a subject that the 90s kids, who proudly call themselves ‘morattu singles’, will identify with — relationship! “These 90s kids are either angry at the 80s kids or jealous of the 2K kids when it comes to relationships. Since he is also a 90s kid, STR wanted to do a song about their morattu single status,” says the source, adding that this song doesn’t refer to the actor’s personal life.

STR is planning to launch the single, which will belong to the baila genre, on February 3, and our source tells us that his team is also trying to get the video of the song out on February 14, for Valentine’s Day. On the film front, Simbu is working out to get into his look for Maanaadu, the pooja of which is likely to happen by January end (probably on January 26, if not, then on January 24). The film will go on floors in the first week of February. He also has some eight days’ shoot left for Maha, which stars Hansika in the lead. “The team is trying to get permission to shoot at an airport. So, once that comes through, he will complete shooting for that as well,” adds the source."

When we reached out to the actor-director for more details, he said, “There was a thought of doing the film with Aamir Khan, but he’s doing other films and things didn’t progress further. Recently, I was approached by a producer for this remake and we thought Nawazuddin would be a great choice as he is a good performer. We met day before for a formal meeting. Though his friends and associates have seen the film, he’s yet to watch it. He’s shooting now, and he should most likely see the film either today or tomorrow. I don’t know what other commitments he has, but I think he’s an expressive actor and will be suitable for the role.”


Parthiban is presently busy with the pre-production work of his next, Iravin Nizhal, which will be a single-shot film. So, if things fall in place, when does he plan to go on floors with the Hindi remake? “The only work I foresee is with respect to dialogues, which will be written in Hindi by another person. I’ll only have to see the final draft. This is a film that need not be adapted per se to suit audiences of other languages because it’s predominantly shot within a room. Also, there are no other actors, and so, combination dates will not be a problem. I’m shooting for a film with Vijay Sethupathi, and a few other films, which will be announced soon. So, the minute Nawazuddin says ‘yes’, I’m ready to start shooting. I’ve lived with this film for so many years and I don’t need any more time to make it again,” he said."

The trailer of the film has received a lot of appreciation and love from the audience.
Deepika is currently busy promoting the film and she is leaving no stones unturned to reach out to the masses.

And now, the actress took to her Instagram to share a new promo of the film. She captioned the dialogue promo as, ""An unusual girl. Wanting a usual life. Vacancy hai? Malti's story unfolds in #Chhapaak. Advance bookings open now. Book your tickets now ( Link in Bio ).""

Check out the post here:



During an exclusive interaction with ETimes, Deepika was asked about Laxmi's reaction after seeing her as Malti for the first time she said, ""I would say when Laxmi walked onto the set for the first time, and she looked at me and she said, ‘I feel like I'm looking at myself in the mirror’. I think for me, that would be the most memorable moment because as an actor to get the validation of the person that you're playing on screen, there is no bigger validation than that. So for me, her validation is something I'll never forget, I'll never forget that validation. It's very, very clear in my mind.""


Meanhile, the film is based on the acid attack survivo Laxmi Agarwal. Helmed by Meghna Gulzar, the film also stars Vikrant Massey in a pivotal role. It will release on Januar 10 this year and will clash with Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan's 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'."

He shared, “I started my career as a software engineer but was always inclined towards acting, right from childhood. Soon after realising that I wasn’t being fair to my passion, I decided to try my hand at modelling and acting. After winning a few modelling competitions, I moved to Mumbai. There I was offered my first role in the hit show Bepannah, which I believe was a fabulous start to my acting career. Somehow my acting was appreciated in that show and after that I was offered more shows like' Yeh Hai Mohabbatein', 'Kundali Bhagya', etc. Post a couple of shows I was given my first film 'Utavle Bavle' directed by Snehal Dabi. So I think the journey has been great so far.”

After playing several negative roles, Varun expressed his desire to play a positive role onscreen. The actor said, “I think my eyes give me a slightly villainous look and probably because of that I’m mostly offered negative roles. Although I would love to do a positive role personally, I can’t say ‘no’ to the work coming my way either.”

Titled Ta Futures, the project will be a participatory venture that will capture Tamil Nadu, its culture and its sounds.
“I got inspired by Tod when I’d gone there to do a course,” begins Rahman, “He does something called city symphony — he goes to a city and creates an artistic work with the sounds from that city. Then, Bharat Bala came in and we decided to do something that will inspire kids... something newer rather than talk about the same thing. We want this to be a gear shift so that children get a new direction in thinking about art, and believing in our nation.”

Rahman says, “We celebrate the old stuff. But there is a question of what we are leaving for the next generation. We want to trigger young minds with this project. There is so much negative energy right now, with talks of war and so on. And we don’t want kids to be influenced by this, but rather free their minds so that there is an environment where they can become thinkers, scientists, innovators, politicians and musicians.”

Ta, Rahman says, stands for thai, thandhai, Tamil, dharmam, tara (stars), rhythm (takadimitha). “It’s a coinage that includes everything,” he says.


In this project, Rahman and his team will be creating certain sounds — the sounds of a weaver’s thari, the songs sung during the harvest, the sounds made by a sculptor at work — that are totally intrinsic to our culture. They are planning on doing this in two ways — the team will go to the places and the people and record the sounds, and they will also create a platform where people can record and send the sounds. These sounds will then be turned into music, a ‘culture-curated artistic project’.


While Chennai will be the melting pot for this project, the sounds will be sourced from across the state — from the coasts of Kanyakumari to the tribal areas of the Todas to the weavers of Kanchipuram. And Tod, a music inventor, will sample these sounds and come up with something very futuristic. He will devise ways to get children to play with such technology.

Rahman says, “There is war and protests happening world over right now, and during this time, the duty of an artiste is to make something beautiful. And when we make collective art that’s beautiful, we create an alternate world.” The final part of this participatory project, Rahman says, will be different. “It will be an exhibition, a concert... many things. I want the output to be a museum that lasts for at least 20 years. Actually, we have many plans, and we will do whatever is practically possible,” he informs."

"Created: Jan 8, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,It’s never too early to set new year resolutions for your child: Parents,"With competitive parenting being quite the norm these days, it’s not surprising that parents make new year resolutions not just for themselves, but for their children too. While some parents believe that setting goals for children and helping them achieve these goals is a must for the child’s growth and development, others argue that resolutions come from the children themselves when they are ready for it. But where does one draw the line? We talk to parents, children and experts to find out...
‘Get your child to set individual targets’


“Resolutions are made by perceiving the current needs and setting appropriate goals to meet those needs. This requires a certain degree of reasoning, planning, judgement, motivation and values, which are not fully developed till the age of 15 years. It is, therefore, important for parents to step in and introduce the habit of setting goals and work towards achieving them within set deadlines,” explains Dr M Thomas Kishore, additional professor of clinical psychology and consultant clinical psychologist in child and adolescent mental health at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS). “New year resolutions are a great way to get children to set targets for themselves. Making joint resolutions, along with their friends, also helps motivate them to do better together. Using self-affirmative statements, such as ‘I can do it’, ‘I stepped up today’, further help them feel good about sticking to these resolutions, which, in turn, increase self-esteem,” explains Dr Gitanjali Narayanan, associate professor in clinical psychology at NIMHANS.

‘Encourage tangible goals to avoid pressure’
Mental health experts suggest parents ought to be realistic when it comes helping their children set targets. “Set small and tangible goals, which are achievable, and ensure that it interests your child. Identify these goals based on whether they help your child find a sense of purpose and direction. Do not pressurise or restrict your child,” says child mental health specialist, Dr Sujata Shenoy, who adds, “Parents should ensure that their sense of achievement should not collide with their child’s.” “If parents do not exercise caution, they may end up rubbing off their ambitions on their children, especially when it comes to academic achievements. This can put tremendous pressure on children. On the other hand, failure to meet these standards set by parents can lead to low self-esteem among children,” points out Dr M Thomas.

Plan, execute, deliver...
Assess your child’s needs and
hobbies
Have a positive discussion about goals with your child and arrive at a consensus. This is team work
Do not impose a goal on your child, it should be something your child looks forward to
Resolutions can revolve around positive change in any area, not just academic achievement
Appreciate your child for all the efforts he/she puts in
As a parent, one of your own goals need to be about how you have helped your child achieve his/her goals
There are times when goals cannot be achieved. Encourage your child to have an alternative plan

Keep the targets simple, easy and varied
Food goals- Eat more greens; reduce snacking between meals

Reading goals - Read more books, Set a deadline to finish reading a story book

Lifestyle goals - Spend time outdoors and lesser time with gadgets; write more; sleep on time, and for a good eight hours

Shehnaz gets shocked seeing him leaving with a pillow and quilt and follows him. She asks Sidharth about the reason behind sleeping in the garden area and an agitated Sidharth tells her he wants to sleep outside.


He puts a fake smile on his face and asks Shehnaz to leave. He tells her to go and sleep. She kisses him on forehead and leaves from there. Next, day Shehnaz behaves strangely during the nomination round and refuses to save Mahira and Arti. Everyone gets surpised by her behaviour as she decides to save Vishal instead of the two girls. Later, Sidharth ignores her throughout the day and Shehnaz gets hurt. Shehnaz takes an unexpected decision and changes her bed. She shifts her place and Vishal gets surprised.

Shehnaz discusses with Rashami Desai that she is hurt as Sidharth is ignoring her. Rashami shouts at her and asks didn't she come alone in the house. She asks her to be self-dependent. She tells her that she should show it to Sidharth that she can stay alone.


In the evening time, Shehnaz tries to persuade Sidharth and talks to him, but the two again end up fighting."

"Created: Jan 8, 2020, 01:00 IST",Riya Sharma,Entertainment,"Deepika Padukone: When you work with a director like Meghna Gulzar, you surrender","In the midst of a marathon promotional schedule for their film 'Chhapaak', as director Meghna Gulzar and actor-producer Deepika Padukone sit down to have a chat with us, we ask them if, for a change, they would want to ask each other questions about the film and the journey they have taken together. “We might go on and on, you will have to tell us when to stop!,” says Deepika, as they sportingly kick off the Q/A session. Later, they share with us the common thread that they found in the acid attacks, the confidence and spirit of the survivors who are part of the film, and why it couldn’t have been set anywhere but in Delhi. Excerpts:
Meghna to Deepika: Were you ever apprehensive about the look that we put you in and how that would impact your fans or the audience?
Deepika: At no point did I think of it from the vanity point of view. Did I think about my look? Yes, but I was thinking, ‘Wow, I have never done a prosthetic-heavy film before, what would that experience be like for me?’ Do I have to look like Laxmi? Do I have to look like myself if, God forbid, I had to go through something like this? Are we going to find a middle ground? I think those were the kind of technical thoughts, about the execution.
Who is the person who is going to execute the prosthetics? Are we going to get someone from India or from outside? But at no point I thought that how is the audience going to think of me or look at me, how is that going to impact my career, my future choice of films – none of those thoughts crossed my mind.

Meghna: I remember the first time we had your costume trial. And there was this wardrobe that had been laid out, which was completely mismatched. And you love to dress up, you are always so immaculately turned out personally also and even in your film, whether you are playing Naina or Piku. Here we had skirts which were of different colours, tops which were of a different colour, the head scarf was mismatched, and for a reason. The space she is in, she is not going to colour-coordinate…
Deepika: I think we got into finer details also like how is that fabric going to feel on Malti’s skin. Having just been through an attack and at what stage of surgery she is at, how is her skin going to react, what would that fabric mean, would it hurt? Would it be soft?

Meghna to Deepika: You submitted completely. There was a never a question, ‘Are you sure about this?’ We have picked up embroidered skirts from Janpath and we have put you in that. What was your first thought when you saw that rack of clothes?
Deepika: I have myself worn clothes from there. All these fancy designer clothes I wear now came much later on in my life. As a model, when I used to come here to Delhi for a lot of fashion shows, I have gone to Janpath myself, I have bought clothes, I have worn them. So I have been familiar with these kind of clothes. That is one part of it, but the other thing is, when you work with Meghna Gulzar or a director like her, you surrender. There are no questions asked. If she has a vision for a character and for a film, you go with it. You may not have that with every director, but I have been very fortunate that in many films I have done, I have been able to blindly trust my director’s vision. So, Meghna, why did I do this film? I keep saying this - because it was your conviction, it was your honesty that you came with for the very first time. I will never forget those moments, I knew I just had to surrender, everything else was done.

Meghna to Deepika: First time producer and actor simultaneously. Was balancing it easy? Well let's not say easy. How is it different?
Deepika: I'm fortunate to have been able to differentiate the roles. I think there were parts where I was playing both actor and producer, but while filming, I was only the actor. Then when we finished filming, again, more of a producer because you're getting into the marketing part of it. Having said that, I mean, I think at every stage it's been a creative involvement. I have not turned producer for financial reasons. I think for both of us, it came from a very creative space of being more involved and what is best for the film and what is best for this character, also because you were dealing with such a sensitive topic, something that hasn't been showcased in mainstream before.

Deepika Padukone as Malti in 'Chhapaak

Deepika to Meghna: What was that one moment when you said, ‘This is it. I am committing the next three or four years of my life to telling Laxmi’s story’. Was it over a period of time that the voice got stronger and stronger in your head or is that one defining moment?
Meghna: It was a moment. It was like epiphany. One moment precisely. In 2016, it was that need to generate your own content, because fortunately for me, after a long time, the avenues of being able to make a film easily were opening up. I wanted to never be in a situation where somebody is asking you to make a film but you don’t have the content ready. In that, when I was scoping subjects in news articles, the issue of acid violence stared me from a newspaper, immediately I knew that it was what I want to do.
And the day I decided that, the next day I woke up in the morning and the silent desire that I had kept inside me for the previous three years, that that is the face I want to play Malti, I voiced it. I picked up the phone on a common colleague and said set up this meeting (with Deepika) please. And the response that I got saamne se was, ‘Are you sure?’ And I was like, ‘Yes, I am sure’. And two days later, I was at your home.

Deepika to Meghna: Why were you, then, apprehensive?
Meghna: I was not apprehensive. I was um, you know, by now that that's my personality that I, I will not voice out the good things. I will always voice out the stuff that can go wrong. Right? So I was not apprehensive, but it definitely felt like a long shot because this perception is there in the audience, even in filmmakers sometimes, and very wrongly so as I realised now, that actors who are successful and have found, I won’t say ‘comfort zone’ because they like to push the envelope in the different characters they play, but their strengths or their calling cards, they don't like to disinvest themselves off that. They like to keep their armour with them as they go from film to film. That is a perception. And so you think of going to Deepika, who has played queens and is like this, the minute you say beauty, she is almost the first name that will come to you. Right? And so because of that perception, you feel that will she risk it? Would she take this up? It's just that. And that morning, even that hesitation went for a toss.

Deepika to Meghna: Now this is a question I've always wanted to ask a director. When you are doing a biopic, such as this, would you as a director look for a person who looks like that character or would it be more exciting for you as a director to find someone who's just a really good actor who you know will bring everything to the table and then make them look like the character?
Meghna: I go with the visual first, because for me, cinema is a visual medium and your sense of sight is what is guiding your entire experience of consuming a film. If I have to take somebody who 60% looks like the character, particularly a real character, then what happens is that the external, fake elements, whether it is the fillers or the prosthetics or hair, that gets diminished. When I'm watching an actor with all that embellishment, it comes in the way for me. So I would not want to do that. I would want to be as close as possible, physically. The exciting part is when you don't have a visual reference, then you just go with a fabulous performer and you create a character. With 'Chhapaak', I've been fortunate that I did a bit of both because, we didn't make Deepika look exactly like Laxmi. You can see a few similarity, visual cues, but it's still Deepika which for me, as a filmmaker and as an audience who would want to go and see her in this role, is extremely gratifying.

Meghna Gulzar and Deepika Padukone

DT: Meghna, how did you maintain that balance between Deepika, Malti and Laxmi?
Meghna: Once I knew what Malti was, I think very organically, very naturally, it had a large part of Laxmi. Also when you're writing, there are parts of you that kind of seep into the characters that you're writing, right? Then the actor comes on board and when you're interacting with the actor, you will go and tweak certain things in the script based on the actor that's going to be playing the part. So with her, if Malti was already spirited, and a little vocal, I made her a little more vocal. That's from my side. 50% of the job the actor does as well. You know, how she has internalised Malti, how she has lived with the character and then it's her interpretation of it as well.

DT: Some actors get very involved with the character, others say, ‘Itna load kyun lete ho, isn’t the director handling that?’. When you are dealing with a subject like this, which model works for you?
Deepika: Sometimes the process might be slightly more familiar and sometimes you've got to put in a little more effort. With this film I think the biggest preparation for me was the emotional preparation. I'm glad we started that process almost six or eight months before we actually started filming. I needed that time to just internalize it. I needed the time to live with it. So that when I walked onto set, I wasn't acting it, I was feeling it. I think that is really when my journey began. Everything else was external. When you walk onto a film set and you have to play every moment in the life of an acid attack survivor, that's when the journey for me really, really began. And I think that's where it's sort of taken a toll on me emotionally.

DT: Meghna, though the incident with Laxmi happened in Delhi, could you have set the film in any other city?
Meghna: I don’t think that I could have set the incident anywhere else because if you're doing true life, and if you don’t have authenticity, then you don’t have your audience and your film. Yes, the actual incident happened near Khan Market, near the road where the Metro station is right now. There's no way I could have actually gone there and shot there and locked down that space for three days, morning to night. So you take smaller liberties and go into say a smaller market to recreate. We fictionalise the names. Laxmi is not Laxmi, she is Malti, so you can take small creative, I would not even say liberties, I will say translations. But I couldn't have placed this elsewhere. Also, I don't know whether I should say this, but I genuinely feel this now that I'm seeing the film from a distance, that the Delhi in our film is very un-“film wala Delhi”. It is not the Delhi that you see in films.
Deepika: (cuts in) It is not the Imtiaz wala Delhi. I say this because he is a friend, Imtiaz has a different way of showing Delhi.

DT: Deepika, at your birthday celebrations in Lucknow, the four acid attack survivors who are a part of the film said there was no sense of discomfort on your face when you met them for the first time, which is unusual for them. This is what they remember of your first meeting with them; how was your experience?
Deepika: It was easy. We met at a restaurant for the first time. I had met Laxmi but I was going to meet these girls for the first time. I remember they walked in, I'll never forget their giggles, their spirit. They were ordering things left, right and center. They were firing the person who was bringing the food because he kept bringing the wrong order. This is my memory of them - spirited. I can't define it in any other way. Then of course, each one has a different personality. The one takeaway I had from all four of them was just their confidence and their spirit. It's amazing.


DT: Meghna, you have earlier spoken about how you wanted to show enough on screen so that people get a little uncomfortable but not so much that they turn away. So how did you manage that balance and was there any part of the story that you didn't show to achieve that balance?
Meghna: I don't think I shied away from anything, in terms of what was crucial to her story being narrated correctly and to do justice to what she had handed to me. I don't think we shied away or omitted anything. Yes, I was very aware that the film needs to have a certain aesthetic level. I was more aware that on this film than on any of my other films. Here we all had a heightened sense of awareness that the aesthetic level of the film needs to be slightly higher because the content is a little, it could be perceived as being difficult to palette.
Deepika: It is also unfamiliar. Unfortunately unfamiliar.

DT: When you spoke to the other survivors for your research, was there a common trait or common thread that you found in terms of the mindset of their attackers?

Meghna: Yes, there is. The reason for an attack can be anything. It's not really just unrequited affection or attention. It can even be a rivalry between two families. And because the girl of the family is regarded as this asset in a very strange way. Ki woh jo izzat hoti hai, laaj hoti hai ghar ki, usko tabah kardo. I think more than an act of disfiguring or violence, it was an act of repressing, of smothering. I will press you down, not just physically, I will press you down spiritually, emotionally, internally. It was that. It's actually a play of power.


Meghna says that she couldn’t imagine setting 'Chhapaak' anywhere other than Delhi


DT: You say the message of the film is hope. While there is definitely hope for the survivors, is there also hope that it'll change the mindset of the assailants? If someone wants to disfigure a woman’s face, will they stop if the sale of acid is stopped? There is a hope that if you are a survivor then you can come out stronger, but is there a hope that you will not be the next victim and it won’t happen with you?

Meghna: I would really like to hope so. I'll say that replacing acid with another tool of violence may not be that easy because of two things. One, how easily accessible it is and now how horrifically violent it is. Finding a similar tool of violence might be difficult. There is no profile of an acid attacker. Like you have profiles of serial killers, murderers, rapists, molesters because of the variety of reasons why it happens. There is no profile of an acid attack. It actually just takes a moment where an everyday, normal, sabhya person flips. I'm hoping that with this film, once you see the journey, you see the destruction it causes, not just for the person who's been attacked, but for her family, for her environment, for society in general, it may be a little bit of a deterrent, I hope. Having said that, I also feel that it's a lot of responsibility to put on a film.

"Created: Jan 8, 2020, 01:00 IST",Roshni Olivera,Entertainment,"Deepika Padukone: I have a boisterous side, which in all of my so-called elegance, people missed seeing","It’s been an eventful decade for Deepika Padukone. She has had a number of successful films to her credit, made her foray into Hollywood opposite Vin Diesel in ‘xXx: Return of Xander Cage’ (2017) and turned producer. On the personal front, too, she is in a happy space and seems a lot more comfortable revealing her quirky side to the world. The new year has begun on a busy note for the actress with her film, ‘Chhapaak’, directed by Meghna Gulzar, set to release in a couple of days. In a chat with BT, she talks about playing Malti, her most emotionally challenging role till date, how she has evolved as a person over the years and why she wants to do a contemporary, light-hearted film with husband Ranveer Singh. Excerpts...
You have experienced a range of emotions from the time you started shooting for ‘Chhapaak’, to the promotions recently, when you broke down on stage. How would you describe this emotional roller-coaster ride?
This has been my most challenging film, emotionally. There was a lot of preparation before we began shooting — look tests, working on the prosthetics, costumes and readings with co-actors and Meghna. I also spent time with Laxmi (Agarwal, the acid attack survivor, who is the inspiration behind her character). But, for a film of this nature, you can never be fully prepared. How do I prepare myself for that moment when acid is thrown on my face? I can imagine that it happened in a certain way, but I can only live it between ‘action’ and ‘cut’. I have had many of those moments of highs and lows, which took a toll on my mental health as well.


How did you cope with that?
I remember on the second day of shoot, I had a panic attack. We were doing the prosthetics when I had the attack because I’m claustrophobic. I broke into a sweat and could feel the blood rushing through my feet, and I remember saying to myself, ‘I can’t do this’. Throughout the film, I was breathing through one nostril because of the prosthetics. I couldn’t eat properly because I couldn’t open my mouth completely. And then, there was the emotional journey. Having said that, I was willing to go through it all because this was a story we had to tell. That was more important than what I had to live with for a few hours every day. Whenever I felt low or vulnerable, I would think about Laxmi and the other survivors, who have been through so much, and that would help me pull through the day.

Meghna has said that you were her only choice for this role...
When a director says that he/she would not have made a film without a particular actor, there is no bigger compliment for that actor. Often in Indian cinema, we make films with roles that are replaceable. Isko nahin toh usko lo, usko nahin to kisi aur ko lo. I’m glad that today, we are getting to a point where films are written in a certain way, where characters are so special that either you make it with a cast that you have in mind or you don’t make it at all. When Meghna narrated this script to to me, I was instantly drawn to the subject. What I was also drawn to was her honesty. I could see her sincerity, sensitivity and a great sense of responsibility. I had seen all of these things in her movie, ‘Talvar’ (2015). It was incredible the way that movie was made — it was such a fragile topic and it was made at a time when the people on whom the film was based were still in custody. Films like these engage you, make a point, and at the same time, are entertaining. It’s difficult to find a director who can strike that balance.

What is your biggest takeaway from your interaction with Laxmi?
I admire her spirit. Also, her ability to articulate her thoughts and feelings. She is honest, candid, confident and has a great sense of humour. She has beautiful hair, too.


Often, the punishment given in an acid attack case is far less compared to the gravity of the crime. Procuring acid is also easy in our country. Do you hope that your film will initiate a major debate that will address these issues?
I hope the film resonates with people at multiple levels, whether it’s pertaining to the legal system, the sale of acid or how we look at women who’ve suffered an acid attack. We tend to treat the survivors as disabled; they don’t have any disability and it’s important for us as a society to recognise that.

Now that you have turned producer with this film, do you look at things differently? As an actor, you must have had a different perspective...
Actually, I have had a couple of people tell me in the past that I would make a good producer. Dinesh Vijan (filmmaker) was the first person to tell me that. He would say, ‘Deepu, one day we will become partners and I’ll make a cabin for you in my office’. At that point, I didn’t think I would produce a film someday. But now when I look back, I remember how during ‘Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’ (2013), I would ask Karan Johar (producer) why he was giving Ayan Mukerji (director) so much liberty with the budget and why he was allowing him to do recce at different places. I think somewhere, I was always interested in what goes on behind the scenes as much as what happens in front of the camera.

Would you agree that when actresses start doing author-backed roles, they end up getting slotted, and are not offered other kind of roles?
Yes, it’s totally possible, so it all depends on the choices one makes. Like the next film I’m doing is a romantic thriller, which is very different from what I have done so far. I have been offered many sports biopics, too, but I haven’t decided on that, yet.


It has been a year since Ranveer and you tied the knot. What are the changes that you see in Ranveer and in yourself? In fact, he recently said that he has become a good boy now, he wakes up early and gets back home on time...
He’s not there yet, but he does try! We have both rubbed off on each other in different ways. I’d like to believe that I have brought in a little more professionalism and discipline into his life. I think he would like to believe that he has brought out the quirky side of me, though I think I have always been like that, it’s just that people saw it in spurts. There is an extremely goofy and funny side to me, which only close friends got to see earlier. Now, when I sometimes show that side of my personality to others, people feel that he has rubbed off on me, which is also a great thing. Ranveer and I support and encourage each other... especially his dressing sense! In a way, there are not many changes from the time we were dating, except that now, we come home to each other. Professionally, we make our own decisions and personally, we decide everything together. For us, it’s been important from the beginning that we retain our own identities. People around us often forget that we are married, which I think is a good thing. Ranveer and I are together and at the same time, we are our own people.

You probably always had that quirky side to you, but the general perception is that you have opened up more post marriage...
Maybe I’m showing it a lot more now. If you ever speak to my school friends, they will tell you that I was a brat. My mother will tell you how, as a child, I was never at ground level; I was always jumping or climbing somewhere. There is a boisterous side to me, which, in all of my so-called elegance, people missed seeing.

Like some of your contemporaries who got married, do you also face questions about when you plan to start a family?
No! I have not been asked this question ever, which is refreshing.

What about doing more movies with Ranveer? There was buzz that you’ve turned down three films together..
There is no truth to that at all.

The reports said that the two of you didn’t want to get over-exposed as a couple...

We don’t think like that at all. We would rather think whether a film warrants the two of us to come together. Again, that’s not a decision for us to make, it’s for the director to decide. We have not been offered anything like that together, though it was refreshing to work with him in ‘83 after having worked in three films, where we die in the end! I hope we get to do more films, maybe something more contemporary and lighter. It’ll be nice for someone to explore our on-screen combination in a different way from what everyone has seen so far.


We’ve just entered a new decade. How do you look back at the decade that’s gone by, a period which was fabulous for you professionally?

I feel gratitude. Nothing fell into my lap, I have worked hard to reach where I am, and to be a part of the kind of films that I get to do today. I want to constantly learn, grow and evolve. I also used the criticism that came my way, constructively. And, I am thankful for the goodwill and support that I got.


Do you feel that you have grown as a person, too?

Yes. I don’t think I was the same person even seven years ago. Every film, every experience, every success, failure, criticism and praise has led me to where I am today. It allows me to grow further, think, express and take risks."

"Created: Jan 8, 2020, 01:00 IST",Riya Sharma,Lifestyle,"Students turn to counsellors, helplines to manage parental pressure and anxiety","Though doctors say that exam stress is common, parental pressure and their high expectations add to the students' anxiety. ""It is not just about exams, but parents and peers also put a lot of pressure on students when it comes to picking a career path,"" say counsellors. They also emphasise that it's necessary for parents to stop pressurising their kids in order for them to not only perform well, but also be in a better state of mind. ""I was never stressed about giving my board exams but my parents had such high expectations from me that I actually ended up stressing a lot about my exams. I had studied enough but I was not at all confident because my parents would keep asking me about my syllabus and they kept worrying about the exams. A month prior to my exams, I finally called one of the exam helplines to discuss my problem, and instead of my parents calming me down, I was the one telling them to take it easy, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to perform,"" shares Rashika Soni, a 17-year-old who sat for her board exams last year.
From seeking help from counsellors to sharing problems with loved ones, experts suggest how rather than cracking under pressure, students should seek help for their mental well-being.


'Important to identify early signs of stress or anxiety'
Anjana Anand, a career counsellor, says, ""It is very important for us to connect with the child because if I am counselling a kid about their career, it is crucial for me to understand what he/she is going through. As far as dealing with stress or anxiety is concerned, we should be able to identify early signs. When there is a problem, accept that there is an issue, there is nothing wrong with it. It is okay to say, 'I am feeling anxious, or I am feeling very negative today'. Acknowledge that and seek help.""

'Students just need someone who listens'

Each year, Central Board of Secondary Education opens its helpline numbers to help students tackle exam-related stress and anxiety. In 2017, as per the data shared by the CBSE, between February 1 and February 15, as many as 1,356 calls were received on their helpline numbers. Out of these calls, 619 were made for psychological counselling by students. ""As students, we already feel the pressure to score well, but when our parents start comparing us to our siblings or their friend’s kids, it doesn’t help. Most students call helplines because they just need someone to listen,"" says Pooja Negi, a 17-year-old school student who lives in Mayur Vihar.
Sometimes, it's not just the parents' expectations that cause anxiety amongst students. ""My daughter would often tell me that she was having trouble solving some mathematics equations. So I took her to a counsellor to simply talk about it and it actually helped. Sometimes, our kids are not able to share what they are actually feeling with us, but the involvement of a third party actually helps,"" shares Jovita Sharma, a resident of Sector 31, Gurgaon.


'Due to competitiveness, self-esteem is now defined through comparison'

The National Mental Health Survey 2015-16, conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, revealed that 9.8 million teenagers in the age group of 13-17 years suffer depression and other mental health disorders and are ""in need of active intervention"".

Samir Parikh, Director & HOD, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Hospital shares that their counselling helpline numbers get 100 calls from school and college students every day. ""Exams, marks, entrance tests are part of our lives. No matter what we do, there is always going to be that pressure. Kids understand that their parents have high expectations from them. There is so much competitiveness that one's self-esteem is defined by a comparison to someone else, which has a negative impact. That is why we tell them to seek help from people who can guide them and ask parents to be open with their kids,"" he says.



'Students often end up choosing a field that their parents want'


""Parents often have a vision for their kids and they then put a lot of pressure on them to choose a field that they want. In 90% of the cases, kids don't choose the field of study that they really want. For example, even some schools don’t support humanities. Once, a student came to me and said that when he told his principal that he wanted to take humanities, she laughed and said, 'But you are a good student! Why humanities?' This is why majority of the students end up taking subjects that they don’t want to study,"" shares Yashi Shukla, a career counsellor."

Pratham Kunwar, who stepped into the shoes of Basant Bhatt to play the new Kartikey in 'Vighnaharta Ganesha', has now been replaced by the latter. Pratham, who joined the cast in September after Basant quit citing date issues, has now exited the mythological show.

Pratham says, “To begin with, I wasn’t happy with the way my character was shaping up. Out of the 15 days a month blocked by the production house, I was being called to shoot for only three days. They promised me that my track will increase soon, however, that didn’t happen. They eventually told me that they are getting the original actor back. I was shocked. Having said that, I don’t grudge anyone, as I feel fortunate to have got the opportunity to play such an iconic character. The only grouse is that I had chosen this project over another that I was offered around the same time.”


On his part, Basant says, “Apparently, the channel wanted me back in the show for the upcoming track and hence, the production house approached me. I hadn’t quit 'Vighnaharta Ganesha'. In fact, I was managing it along with 'RadhaKrishn', but it became difficult to adjust the schedule of other artistes. That’s when the production house decided to get in another actor to play the part. I am back now and am willing to put in extra hours for the show.”"
,"Created: Jan 8, 2020, 01:00 IST",Entertainment,The history behind Tanhaji's win and rise of the Maratha Empire,"Tanhaji Malusare’s conquest of Kondhana Fort with 300 men was impressive on its own. But what made it even more significant for the Marathas was the fortress’ strategic value and emotional importance for Shivaji
Kondhana’s significance for Shivaji:
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established control of the Kondhana fort as a 16-year-old in 1646. It was one of his first military victories, which is why the fort continued to hold a special place for him emotionally.


Was Kondhana ‘impenetrable’?: The fortress was located in a region that formed as the gateway to the heart of what would later become the Maratha Empire. Whoever controlled it could easily control the region. It was built on the edge of a cliff 760 metres above the ground with natural protection in extremely steep slopes. Hence, it was considerd impenetrable, which made Tanhaji conquering it with just 300 men such an impressive feat



Losing the fortress to the Mughals:

The Marathas, under Shivaji, confronted the Mughals from 1657-64, registering several important victories. In 1665, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent Rajput commander Mirza Raja Jai Singh I with a force of 15,000 to defeat Shivaji. After luring several of Shivaji’s commanders into Mughal service, Jai Singh cornered him at Purandar, forcing him to surrender


Treaty of Purandar:

After his defeat in 1665, Shivaji signed a treaty with the Mughals, surrendering 23 forts – including Kondhana – apart from agreeing to become a Mughal vassal. This is how his treasured fortress went under Mughal control


Reconquest and the Maratha Empire:

In 1670, after relations between Shivaji and the Mughals soured, he launched a massive reconquest. Kondhana was one of the first forts he targetted. The win at Kondhana enabled his armies to win back most of the lost territory within four months. In 1674, Shivaji was crowned the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire. And it all started with Tanhaji at Kondhana"

The comedian-turned-actor had taken a 15 day break to be with his newborn baby girl and wife Ginni Chatrath.

The actor is shooting for the show today with Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff. He had last shot with Deepika Padukone and Ajay Devgn and wife Kajol.


The dedicated actor was shooting non-stop during the last trimester of his wife’s pregnancy so this was a much needed break for Kapil and his family. In fact, earlier, there were reports that due to Ginni’s delivery Kapil had shot a few episodes back-to-back so that he could be with his wife at the time of his baby’s birth.

After marriage with Ginni, Kapil has completely become a family man and dedicates most of his time to his family. The second season of The Kapil Sharma Show is doing well on the TRP charts. Recently, the show completed 100 episodes and a huge celebration bash was organised for the cast and crew. The cast was seen having a blast at the party and they danced their heart out.


Kapil and Ginni got married on December 12, 2018 and they recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary."

Several thousands of his fans thronged the Nandi Link Grounds, at Nayandahalli, for a gala midnight celebration, flanked a 216-foot cut out and a 5,700-kg cake. Yash turned up at the venue with his wife, actress Radhika Pandit, to greet and meet those who braved the winter night to wish their hero. The event was organised by Akhila Karnataka Rocking Star Yash Abhimanigala Sangha (R).
Yash said, “Nanna preethiya annthammas. I have never given much importance to my birthday celebrations. Since my childhood, I had just one wish — I should not celebrate the fact that I was born, instead others should be happy on my birthday. Had I chosen another profession, I wonder if I would have got so much love and adulation. I feel blessed that I have chosen this path.”

According to a source, people came in from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana as well as different parts of Karnataka to get a glimpse of the actor and wish him. “Many even stayed overnight at the venue, so that they could interact with Yash and click photos with him,” the source added.
Mr and Mrs Ramachari in awe of the mega cake

A CAKE CUTTING LIKE NO OTHER: Yash and Radhika Pandit (above) were in awe of the 5,700 kg cake (right) made for Yash by fans. The enormous sweet treat, was one of the most-talked features of the celebration — the icing on the cake read, ‘Happy Birthday Yash Boss.’

One dialogue for the crowd...

Amid the revellery, Yash also gave fans a sneak peek of his upcoming film, KGF: Chapter 2. He delivered a dialogue from the movie:

“ Yenande? Ondu hejje itkondu bandhavanu anta heldya? Correct. Gadiyaradalli ondu ghante agbeku andre doddu mullu 60 hejje idbeku. Chikku mullu? Ondu hejje itre saaku.

"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,-,‘It was a surreal experience when Thalaivar said ‘Chumma Kizhi’’,"It’s not always easy to both end a year and begin another one on a grand note. But for Anirudh, this has happened. It was a Chumma Kizhi year-end for the youngster, with his songs for Rajinikanth’s Darbar making waves in December. And now he’s having a happening new year, with the AR Murugadoss directorial hitting screens today, making it his first release of 2020. In a chat with us, the musician talks about working with AR Murugadoss and the Superstar again, how he would never miss releasing a Valentine’s Day single and why he doesn’t hate any trends…
Darbar is your second collaboration with Rajinikanth after Petta. Were you conscious about not repeating yourself in terms of sounds?
I always follow my heart. Whichever song excited me as a fan is what I’ve locked on. There are a few signature sounds for Thalaivar which I included, like the ‘hey hey’ and the Superstar theme.

This is also the second (or should we say, third, after Marana Mass and Petta Paraak?) time you have got the Superstar to render a line or two for your song. How is his energy inside the recording studio?

Actually, Chumma Kizhi was the first time he recorded a line for the song. It was a surreal experience for all at the studio when he said those words.

What was the best review you heard from the film’s team? The one you saw at the end of the making-of video — ‘Super Ani. Idhu theatre-la Chumma Kizhi dhaan’ (by Rajinikanth).

Recently, the Cine Musicians’ Union had alleged that you’d used just four of its members to record for Darbar, and had opted for several foreign musicians. Did you get a chance to clarify the issue with them? Also, do you think it curbs a musician’s freedom when such conditions are imposed on him?
It does not curb a musician’s freedom at all, as our musicians are as good as foreign musicians, if not better. Yes, I did use the orchestra from abroad extensively in this film. But the allegation surprised me as I have used hundreds of our native musicians regularly, from 3 till now. I missed out on the last couple of times due to schedule and availability constraints. But I will continue to use our musicians in my future films.

You are currently working on at least four big movies featuring top stars in the film industry. How do you make sure the work you do doesn’t consume you?
I enjoy every moment, every note, every chord that I produce. The love of my fans keeps me going and helps me raise the bar every time.


Do we get to hear your Valentine’s Day single this year as well?

I hope so (smiles). It’s a tradition which I won’t miss. I have a couple of songs ready, but I will decide which one to release, depending on my mental state on V-Day.


It’s a brand-new decade. Tell us one trend in the music space that you loved, and one trend that you hated.

One trend that I loved is that there are so many new composers and producers all over the world. Technology has made music so accessible and the reach that we all have all around the world is because of that. I don’t hate any trend at all. If it’s a trend, it’s what the people are enjoying and that’s what I want to enjoy as well.


And, is there a New Year resolution that you have made this time around?

This year, I hope to spend more time with people that matter."
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Hansy Sanctis,Entertainment,Ek Haan allows me to express my take on Manto: Shekhar Suman,"Film and television actor Shekhar Suman is set to take the stage in Bengaluru as Saadat Hasan Manto in Ek Haan — a Hindi-Urdu play set in the early 1950s. He will share the stage with actress-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who will be seen as a Kashmiri journalist, named Wazira. The storyline explores the life and writings of Manto through the eyes of Wazira, who follows him from India to Pakistan. The conversation between them forms the crux of the narrative, with the focus also being on some of Manto’s popular stories such as Toba Tek Singh, Kali Salwaar and Thanda Gosht. Excerpts from an interview with Shekhar…
You are back in Bengaluru with another Hindi-Urdu play. What are your expectations this time?
I have a lot of respect for the audiences in Bengaluru. They are well-read and very responsive. Ek Haan, like my previous play Ek Mulaqaat, has a fair amount of Urdu dialogues. But I am sure, it will be received well by the people here, as it has been in other cities of the country. The memories of my previous performances in this city are very rewarding.


When were you introduced to Manto’s works? As a child, one is introduced to different literary works by their parents, and it was the same was in my case too. Manto’s works echoed the real stories of his time, punctuated with excellent wordplay. His stories, particularly Toba Tek Singh are Kali Salwaar, are extremely well-written. You realise how good a writer Manto was when you pick up a book written by him immediately after finishing one.


You took three more months to do an in-depth research on Manto. Did that involve watching plays and movies made on him as well?

I haven’t seen many plays or movies on Manto earlier, which, in a way, I feel, is good, as I wanted to have my own interpretation of the great writer, and not get influenced by anything that I have seen before. This play has given me the opportunity to express my take on Manto, and if my hard work pays off, then the audience will probably remember that. In a way, it is also a sort of revival — introducing Manto to people who are not acquainted with his works.


You are working with Suchitra for the first time. How has been the experience?

Working with Suchitra has been a wonderful experience. She’s quite the perfectionist, who puts in a lot of effort towards the portrayal of the character she plays. Also, for Ek Haan, the dedication with which she has learnt Urdu is praise-worthy. The interaction between Manto and Wazira in the play is organic, realistic and hard-hitting."
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,-,‘I deliberately did not reveal Darbar’s plot in the trailer’,"The excitement is palpable as Darbar, starring Rajinikanth and Nayanthara releases today. Director AR Murugadoss tells us how it was working with the Superstar, and more…
How is this cop character of his different from the cop roles Rajinikanth has played earlier?
The perception of a cop has changed over the years. Earlier, one would expect a cop to be bulky — but today, cops are expected to be fit. Rajini sir’s lean body and style suits today’s perception of a cop. Though he has done Moondru Mugam, Anbukku Naan Adimai and Hum, Darbar has him presented in a different manner. Initially, I wanted Rajini sir to play a retired cop. But after seeing him in Petta, I thought of presenting him as a young cop. The story, however, is the same as the original.


How challenging was it to direct the Superstar...
I was a bit nervous in the first few days, I felt like this was my first movie. Later, I overcame the nervousness, but I was excited. I had certain expectations about how he would perform and deliver his dialogues. But to my surprise, he came up with different modulations for some of the dialogues. He would pause at unexpected places, turn back at some instances, and then laugh… I had a great time looking at him enacting the scenes I had written for him.
You’re working again with technicians like Santosh Sivan and Anirudh…
Santosh sir works at a fast pace — this makes us more professional. He is an expert in maintaining the mood of a scene with his lighting pattern. For example, we are in the middle of shooting an emotional scene, and we take a break and return to complete the scene; the expression or the body language of the artiste may change without his/her knowledge. But Santosh sir knows how to correct it with lighting, and it is magical. Similarly, Anirudh is someone who keeps coming up with tunes even after you say enough. There was one song which I had already shot, but I asked him for another tune, and he gave it immediately, and we shot it again.

How did Suniel Shetty come on board?
As the film has a Mumbai backdrop, I needed an antagonist from there. I met him, and felt he would suit the role. He had a ponytail when I met him and that has been retained in the movie; also, his inclusion has made the film a pan-India project.


This is the second time you chose Mumbai as the backdrop for a Tamil film…
It’s almost impossible to shoot a Rajini film in Tamil Nadu, also, since it’s a cop flick, we needed some real locations. Mumbai has an ultra-modern look on one side, and slum on the other side. It is the only city which has that contrasting ambience. Plus, I’m familiar with the city and it is a shooting-friendly place.



You kept the subject of Darbar in the dark, in the trailer…
Whenever my films’ trailers release, some controversies and rumours crop up — it’s as if some people are just waiting to criticise my film when it is about to release. So, this time, I decided not to encourage them.



Is there a social message in the film?
This is not a message-oriented film; it is a cop thriller which has lot more than action, heroism and gunshots. It also has emotional scenes. I have ensured that the fun element that’s there in Rajini sir’s films is retained."
,"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Entertainment,Kalyani: People need to see more of me to know what I am capable of,"While Kalyani Priyadarshan made her debut with the Telugu film Hello more than two years ago, she has waited for her first leading role in her mother tongue, Malayalam. The reason, she says, had a lot to do with what her parents, Priyadarshan and Lissy, have accomplished in the industry. But her upcoming film Varane Avashyamund, directed by Anoop Sathyan and has Dulquer Salmaan, Suresh Gopi and Shobana as part of the cast, made it “well worth the wait”.
The actress, who is also part of Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham and Vineeth Sreenivasan’s Hridyam this year, tells us about working in Varane Avashyamund, meeting Dulquer for the time and more.

Varane Avashyamund features talent powerhouses. It must have been a unique experience working with them.

My favourite character has always been Karthumbi (Shobana’s role in Thenmavin Kombathu) and so, I have been a huge fan of hers. I grew up seeing her at our house. As a fangirl, however, there’s a difference between knowing her and watching her act. It was a big deal for me. On the first day, there was a retake and to maintain continuity, people were checking the monitors for the previous scene. But ma’am said, ‘I know what I did. I have worked without monitors all these years. If you guys want to have a check, go ahead’. She is that good. There’s no way I can do something like that. But, between action and cut is the only time she works; otherwise she’s like a child on the sets.
Suresh Gopi sir was also fun to work with. He was very chilled to talk to and gives many inputs. He loves amma and kept telling me funny stories about her that I never knew.


You are now probably one of the few actresses who have acted with both Dulquer and Pranav Mohanlal.

I grew up with Pranav. He and I have been best friends for the longest time. In fact, I introduce him to people as my cousin. That’s been our bond since childhood. We used to spend our holidays together. So, working with him was really comfortable and easy. I never went in expecting anything new, because I already knew him so well.

But working with Dulquer was an opposite experience. The first words he ever said to me was on the day of this film’s pooja and it was, ‘Finally, we meet’. That was the first time we were properly meeting. I have never interacted with him before. There might have been a chance that we have seen each other in a film wedding or function as kids. I have known his wife (Amal Sufiya) but Dulquer was never part of my circle. I am close to the children of acha’s friends’. So, it was nice meeting Dulquer and getting to know him.

The film is also about a mother-daughter bond. How much could you relate to your character Nikki?

A lot. I think any mother-daughter duo who argues would relate to their story. I think that’s what I liked about the character. You bond not just through love, but also through tiffs and the fun you share. The movie is not just about their bond though, there’s a lot else happening too.

You have worked in Telugu and Tamil movies before doing Varane Avashymund. Was there a big difference?

This team felt more like family. Despite Sathyan (Anthikad) uncle being someone whom I have met so many times in life as he and acha are close friends, I met Anoopetta for the first time when he came to narrate the story to me. I loved it and I immediately agreed to do it.

The whole film takes place in a very small bubble, of these people’s lives. All of us started living in that bubble during the shoot. One of the first things that even Dulquer told me was, ‘Do you know why I think this film is special and it would work? Because the world he (Anoop) creates is small, but nice. I think the people that watch the film will feel like they want to be part of this small world’. We all felt it was true.

From Hello to Hridayam, how are the characters that are being offered to you changing?

I think people need to see more of me to know what I am capable of. In fact, that’s the reason I am excited about Varane Avashyamund, because the role I am playing is not something I have done before. And yet it’s still more me than the other characters I have played. I am really waiting for people to see this and tell me what they think because this is something that will show my potential a little bit more. I am excited about that.

A lot of Malayali actresses start in Malayalam before branching out to Tamil and Telugu. But you have done the reverse. Why?

A lot of it has to do with the pressure of being my parents’ daughter. When I did a Malayalam movie, I wanted to be at a space where I was a bit more confident as an actor and at the same time, I wanted it to be a struggle as well. Sometimes, when you watch something, you ask, ‘Why did she do this role? There’s nothing for her to do’. I didn’t want that to happen. Acha spent almost 40 years making a name in the industry and I was scared that in just one film I could bring all that down. Though a newcomer, the pressures of everything they have done will be on me. I didn’t want that. So, I took a long time to decide which film to start with. But this movie is worth the wait.




Did you bounce the idea off your parents that this is the film you wanted to make you Malayalam debut with?

I did and acha was the happiest. For him, it is all about how positive he feels about a film. He said, ‘The people who are in the film are here for the right reasons. They are all smart and talented. This is best place for you, not just to be but to learn too’. Acha wants me to learn the right way, because he believes if you learn it wrong, it’s hard to unlearn. He also believes so much in Anoopetta’s ability, not because of who his dad is, but because of who he is and what he has done. I have learnt so much from him and it’s the same with Dulquer. He is the co-star I have learnt the most from. In fact, there were a lot of times when I felt unsure about my performance and a talk with him would help me understand and be okay with what I have done. He is that sort of person. Working with him and Shobana ma’am taught me a lot.


Your latest Tamil film Hero got a good reception. How has the journey there been?

Because I grew up in Chennai, I am more comfortable in Tamil. I think I probably would have watched slightly more Tamil movies than Malayalam films. So, it’s a language I am in touch with and it’s very special to be part of the Tamil film industry because I grew up watching the films. I am happy with the projects I have got so far and I am hoping I can be part of good projects in the future too."
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,Sunil Chhetri: I'm really greedy when it comes to goals,"Bengaluru FC (BFC) and India team captain Sunil Chhetri has had a great start to 2020, what with him scoring two goals against FC Goa in his club team’s first match of the year. For a while now, Chhetri has consistently been the top scorer and is among the top 10 players who have scored the most international goals. Not surprising, considering that the ace footballer says that the one thing he is greedy for on the field is scoring goals, adding that he has been fortunate to be a part of teams that have always stood by him and helped him achieve these feats. Excerpts... What’s 2020 going to be like for BFC and, more specifically, for you?
That’s a difficult question to answer. I have never ever had a long-term plan or a target. I just think about the next 10 days of training or the next game. If I were to summarise it in a holistic way, I just want to do better as a player and for BFC to improve as a team. I sincerely want BFC to win the league and qualify to the Champions League. But in this quest, we’re going to take one game at a time, which is my personal mantra as well. On a personal note, being more calm is another goal that I am looking at achieving.
Bengaluru FC has become the default home team as far as sporting teams that the city supports are concerned. What is your take on the growth in this fan base...
It is amazing; it is second to none in the entire country right now. We might not be there in terms of numbers, but the voice, passion and innovation that the fans bring to the table is amazing. The growth in the past six years has been tremendous. We have grown in terms of quality and depth. The fans are very important to our club and I know that they are aware of this. On behalf of the team, I’d say that the fans have played an important part in getting the club to where we are now.
Not long ago, it seemed that Sree Kanteerava Indoor Stadium, the team’s home ground, would be unavailable for most of the season. How connected is the team to the stadium?
The stadium is very close to our hearts. When we got to know that there was a chance that we might not be able to play at the stadium any more, every one of us was really sad. We’re relieved and grateful that we got the stadium and I hope it stays this way. I know there are a lot of things involved in it and I don’t want to comment on that. But, as a team and a player, there are some amazing memories attached to the stadium and we are not done yet. We have to make a lot more memories on home ground. This is why the stadium is very important.

Earlier, football fan rivalries were limited to teams in West Bengal. Now, we see fans passionately supporting their teams across the nation.
It is beautiful. As the national captain, I think it is very heartwarming. It delights me when fans from other regions come to our homeground at Kanteerava Stadium or our fans travel with us elsewhere. This is a very important part of football growing in the country. It is not easy as far as the kind of time, money or interest that fans spend on their teams are concerned, but this kind of passion will go a long way in promoting the sport. Recently, when we played FC Goa, the fans there had their own banners and were very loud, making sure their appreciation was noted. I’m glad that the fans are taking the right strides in improving the popularity of the sport in the country.
You’re among the top goal scorers, both internationally and in the league, what’s the secret?
The secret is that I play for really good sides, by which I mean both BFC and the national team. I am a part of teams in which the players really help me get to the opportunities to score. I’ve said this before, I’m only the one who gets the cherry on top. People work really hard for me to get those chances. I’m not trying to be modest; I’m just being honest. In the last six years, I’ve been the highest scorer for the club, but that is only because of the team work involved in getting those chances. You’re among the top 10 international goal scorers of all time. Right now, your number of goals are constantly compared to Lionel Messi. Did you ever foresee this?
As far as those comparisons, I don’t pay any heed to them. It is not realistic. I am just happy that I score goals for my club and the country. I’m really greedy when it comes to goals. Every game that I play, irrespective of who it is against or where the game is being played, I always try to score well. Eventually, when I do score and the team gets three points because of that, it is very satisfying. Even though I don’t have a set number of goals in mind, when I start a season, I always give myself the best chance to score.

"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,Bigg Boss Kannada taught me to take a stand and raise my voice: Chandana,"The latest contestant to be evicted from the Bigg Boss Kannada house, actress Chandana Ananthakrishna was one of the most non-controversial on the show this season. Chandana, who spent 12 weeks in the house, tells us, “Honestly, I didn’t think I would last this long in the house. I had given myself five or maybe eight weeks at the most, going by the competition. I am really grateful to the people who supported me in my journey on the show.” The idea behind taking part in this season of Bigg Boss Kannada, says Chandana, was to give audiences a glimpse of her real self as well as her other talents. “People know me as a television actress, I wanted to show them that I have a bunch of other talents, which came to the fore during the various tasks that we had to do on the show. In fact, I did very well when I was the captain of the house. The show helped me showcase a different side of my personality,” she says.
Her biggest takeaway from the stint, says Chandana, is that she learnt to take decisions and stick by them. “It doesn’t matter whether people like your opinion or not, it is up to you to take a stand and raise your voice whenever there is a need, especially against social injustices,” she says, adding that her fondest memories from the house include the morning wake up call, having a microphone on at all times and the time when Sudeep hugged her.

Throughout her stay, Chandana always had smile on her face, irrespective of the mood in the house. “My smile is god’s gift to me. I believe that every problem can be solved with a smile; there is no need to shout at anyone. This is not something I adopted for the show. In fact, even at home, I am not known to lose my temper,” she says. Despite her affable nature, the actress was criticised for being close only to Shine Shetty and Vasuki Vaibhav. “The three of us share a great rapport, owing to our love for music, among other things. We used to sing songs and discuss music whenever we were free, which helped us bond. I don’t think we resorted to groupism in the house to harm other contestants,” she adds.


Chandana votes... Who should be out: Priyanka, because I don’t think she has been honest in her dealings in the house. During her captaincy stint, she took some biased

decisions, which is why I decided to nominate her.

Who should win: Vasuki is the strongest contender to win the show. He entertains by composing songs, and is focused while doing tasks, which makes him the best bet to emerge victorious."

I felt there was a greater challenge lying in those characters than playing larger-than-life characters in mythological or historical shows. But, in the past few years I feel that though the content in social dramas is really good; every TV show starts with a great promise, the track or the characters. somewhere get lost as time progresses. This does not mean that social dramas are not good. ”


Ajay was last seen playing the role of a father ('Rishton Ka Chakravyuh'), who does not love his own daughter. He said, “'=Rishton' had a good concept. It was a modern version of Mahabharat and every actor brought something to the table. However, as time progressed, the characters and story lost its steam. It stopped abruptly without a defined ending and that was disappointing.”

Observing that high-quality content is ruling other platforms, Ajay said that television should also experiment with its content. He shares, “Now, actors have more options to explore their talent. Bollywood filmmakers are interested in making shows on other platforms. So, it is important that the content on social dramas as well as historical shows gets better on TV.”


On the personal front, Ajay is married to actress Jyoti Makker, and they have a daughter, Jiyana. Jyoti quit acting after she became a mother in 2013. Ask Ajay about it and he says, “It was Jyoti’s decision to be a hands-on mother.”


On her part, Jyoti adds, “I did not want to miss out on my daughter’s childhood, but I have started missing my work. Jiyana is a little older now and I am looking forward to working in TV shows.”"

"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,TV,Neha Dhupia: The first word I taught my daughter was ‘bas’. She should know when to say ‘enough’,"Soon after winding up her day-long schedule in Delhi recently, Neha Dhupia was set to fly to Chandigarh for another event. She was literally counting hours to be with her daughter, Mehr Dhupia Bedi. ""I started shooting when my daughter was just 45 days old. And now that she is growing up, I look forward to spending as much time with her as possible, even if it is the time when she is sleeping,"" Neha tells us.

The actress, who was in Delhi for 'Roadies Revolution' auditions, sat for a brief chat with us, mostly about her daughter. ""Mehr hasn't seen me or Angad (Bedi) on screen as she hasn't had any screen time yet. But we have a pile of magazines lying in one of the corners of the house, and as she can crawl now, she saw me on one of the magazine covers and recognised me. When Angad's pictures are in papers, she would recognise him, too,"" Neha says.

The doting mama says that her daughter has learnt some words and she can't wait for baby Mehr to talk to her. ""The first word I taught her was ' bas'. She should know when to say enough. If the food being fed is too much she says 'bas', if she is being forced to do anything or if somebody is pulling her cheeks more than she would like, she knows that she has to say 'bas'. She knows how to say no. Strong women raise strong daughters and I always tell my daughter that if she is not comfortable, she should just say it. The other day she was playing and somebody tickled her and she said 'bas, bas'. So she knows when she has to say no, and she would apply it for the rest of her life now. A lot of parents (and I respect them) have huge aspirations about which institution their child should go to or what their children should do. As a mum, I feel that I want to raise my daughter believing that she has a voice and she should know how to exercise the power of that voice,"" shares the actress.

She also proudly reveals that her daughter has started showing interest in cricket. ""She spins the ball very well. It's very cool to see her do that. We are a family connected to cricket, everyone knows that my father-in-law (Bishan Singh Bedi) and Angad used to play cricket. I grew up watching a lot of sports. So, as parents we couldn't be happier to see that she is so much interested in sports already,"" says Neha, who also plans to take her daughter to Arun Jaitley Stadium (Feroz Shah Kotla Ground) soon. She adds, ""My father-in-law has a stand named after him there and I would like to show that to my daughter. I would want her to know who her grandparents are, what value systems they believe in. I also want her to know Delhi as not just her grandparents' place, but also as a place where both her parents grew up and have so many memories."""
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Onkar Kulkarni,Entertainment,Sharad Kelkar: The director told me dialogues theatre mein goonjne chahiye,"Sharad Kelkar has been a part of numerous television shows and now, has many films to his credit, but that still didn’t prepare him for the time he was approached for the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the film 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior'. “I thought they were looking for a bigger star for the role,” says the actor, adding, “I was shocked that they were considering me for the part. Of course, eventually, I was happy to see the resemblance during the look test.” In fact, his avatar as the Maratha warrior king seems to have confused his five-year-old daughter Kesha, who on spotting the historical figure’s statue at the Gateway of India, asked him, “Dad, is that you?”

'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' is Sharad’s first brush with a period film. “Since it’s my first historical film, I was very careful about the way I portrayed the character. Om Raut (director) made me rehearse each scene several times. He wanted me to portray the character so strongly that he said, ‘Dialogues theatre mein goonjne chahiye’. He boosted my confidence so much that I did not have a single retake. Everybody has read about Shivaji Maharaj’s bravery and his strategies, but this film reveals new aspects of his personality — like the bond he shared with his mother Rajmata Jijabai as well as Tanhaji.”


Speaking about his off-screen bond with co-star Ajay Devgn, who plays the titular role, he says, “I have worked with Ajay in Baadshaho, and he would leave us in splits. This time, however, it being a period film, we were serious on the set.”

Currently busy shooting for his South film, Sharad is excited about making his debut in Tamil cinema with Ravikumar’s sci-fi starring Sivakarthikeyan. The actor , who’s known for his deep voice, is also looking forward to dub Hindi versions of international movies. “I enjoyed working on 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage'. I hope the franchise reaches out to me again,” he signs off."
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Nehha Pendse: What’s the big deal if my husband is twice divorced? I am not a virgin either,"It’s been barely four days since she tied the knot with Shardul Singh Bayas, a businessman, and TV actress Nehha Pendse is already fielding questions about her husband being twice divorced and having two daughters, after recent reports in the media.

Speaking to BT, Nehha said, “What’s the big deal about this? Today, many of us are getting married late because of various reasons, including the focus on career. A lot of people end up having more than one relationship before finally tying the knot. The commitment, love and physical proximity could be the same as it is in a marriage, the only difference is that there is no legal stamp over it. So, why are people talking about Shardul being a divorcee? It’s not that I am a virgin either. I appreciate the fact that he took chances with women he was in love with, unlike in my case where the men disappeared just when the relationship could have culminated into marriage. At least, Shardul is not commitment-phobic. I salute him for his undying faith in the institution of marriage, it is easy to not believe in it after two failed marriages. That shows that he is a man of substance unlike those who fear the idea of getting married. I also feel that if a marriage is not working out, one should end it rather than drag on.”


‘Shardul and I have accepted each other’s past wholeheartedly’
Nehha said that she never intended to hide the fact that Shardul was previously married. “I knew that this would come up at some point and was open to talking about it. Shardul and I have accepted each other’s past wholeheartedly, so there is no fear of talking about it. As I had mentioned in my previous interview to BT, we would hardly have romantic conversations during the initial months of our relationship; there was a lot of talking, but about our lives. Both of us are damaged and hence, careful and sensitive about our relationship.”

Nehha has met Shardul’s first wife and his two children and is in fact, friends with his elder daughter on social media. “His first marriage ended around 10 years ago and second, five years ago,” she said, adding, “They (his first wife and daughters) were gracious enough to meet me and I realised that their relationship had ended amicably. They were young when they got married and made some mistakes. But what’s important is that they remain cordial and Shardul is a doting father.”

‘Shardul won’t make the mistakes that a rookie husband might’
Nehha said that she is a practical person and her expectations from the marriage are realistic. “Let’s be honest. Who knows what the future holds for us? I am extremely practical and aware of the fact that anything can go wrong even in a seemingly strong relationship. I have been married for just a few days, and can’t predict how things can change in a few years. All I can say is, I am open to embracing everything that life has to offer me. Janam-janam ka saath is restricted to just films, real life is a lot more than that. On the positive side, I think Shardul won’t make the mistakes that a rookie husband might. He knows better what works in a marriage and what doesn’t. He will know before me when we have headed in the wrong direction and will guide me through it,” she signed off."
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Chaudhary,TV,"Pankhuri Awasthy: Every time I get a call for a web show, they start by saying, ‘bold scenes hai'","TV actress Pankhuri Awasthy, who is currently seen as Vedika in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai (YRKKH) is set to make her Bollywood debut in Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. The actress was recently in Jaipur to celebrate the New Year with her husband, Gautam Rode. The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Alwar in 2018 and will complete two years this February. The actress mentioned that the desert state holds a special place in both their hearts. “I’ve visited Rajasthan a lot of times, especially Jaipur. Gautam is from Delhi and I have lived in Delhi for 10-12 years. We often come to Jaipur for holidays. The city is so colourful and rich in culture and traditions. I love the architecture of the city and shopping in the walled city is an experience in itself,” she said.
Pankhuri Awasthy and Gautam Rode in Jaipur

Though she has been getting a lot of offers for web shows, the actress has always stayed away. When we asked her about it, she said she isn’t comfortable going bold onscreen which is usually the first question the makers for web shows ask. “I get a lot of offers for web shows, but I am not comfortable doing bold scenes. Every time I get a call for a web show, they start by saying, ‘bold scenes hai.’ Also, I feel that a scene like that should make sense and not just be an addition to grab eyeballs.”

She mentioned that not just her, but even her husband finds doing intimate scenes onscreen uncomfortable. “The moment we are told that we’re required to perform intimate scenes, the first thing that comes out of our mouth is ‘no’. Maybe, because we haven’t done it before. Having said that, we’ve never imposed restrictions on each other. But I know that even Gautam will agree to a project with intimate scenes if the script demands it,” she added.

Though Pankhuri’s character in one of the longest running TV show YRKKH is about to come to an end, she had a fulfiling experience. “I joined the show to play a cameo for three months. When I was confirmed for Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, a day later I was also finalised for YRKKH. The shooting for the film was supposed to begin from September. So, I had some free time, which is why I took up YRKKH. But my track got extended and it’s been almost eight months since I’ve been shooting for the daily soap. I have no complaints as this show is a legacy in itself and my character has a lot of shades. I am happy that playing a different character like Vedika has added value to my career,” she said.


So, what next? We asked. To which, she replied, “I am excited and nervous about my Bollywood debut. I haven’t chalked out a plan yet. But I am hoping that interesting projects come my way and I get to choose the best of what I am offered.”


Opening up about reality shows, the actress said, “I don’t know if I am meant for reality shows. I might do a dance-reality show, but I don’t see myself doing a show like Bigg Boss.”"
"Created: Jan 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,Health fix: Quick meals in your mason jar,"Picture this. You’re leaving for work and reach for your lunch box and to take with you. But hold on to that thought. How about simply adding your food to a mason jar and packing that to carry with you to office? It’s something that you could have done last night, it’s portable, great for holding layered food like salads, soupy noodle meals and is visually appealing, too. In fact, those granola layers with strawberries and yoghurt or even red velvet cake pictures are Instagram-gold!

Biryani to salad and lasagna...
There are immense possibilities with this transparent jar trend. Most popular is a layered salad that can be assembled in it. Restaurants are serving juices and other drinks in mason jars. You can also serve a pie, ravioli, lasagna and other dishes in the jar. Says food expert Isha Marwani, “You can enjoy sushi in a mason jar, too, though it would be in a deconstructed form. Take a smaller sized jar, add some brown rice to it, followed by seaweed, sliced carrot, avocado and ginger, and add some sushi vinegar to it along with lime juice. Top it with a little wasabi and you are set.”

Indian food isn’t far behind either. Reveals senior corporate manager Elson Sequeira, “I recently went to a wedding where biryani was served in mason jars. What struck me was that these jars were the perfect size when you crave something and yet want to exercise portion control, especially for a heavier dish. I do believe mason jars are here to stay.”


‘Works well for Indian desserts, too’



Don’t stop at cakes or trifles, there’s a lot more that makes its way into a mason jar. Affirms chef Pooja Dhingra, “It’s so versatile, that it works well for Indian desserts. I’d go with a kheer, perhaps a rich shahi tukda with varq, a colourful falooda with vermicelli and even a seasonal gajar halwa topped with toasted pistachios and other dryfruit.”

Says foodie Shradha Agarwalla, “I have created so many desserts in the mason jar. You can also do everyday granola layers with mousse or lemon curd. I have made sweet banoffee pies, cheesecakes as well gulab jamun-cake fusions and rasmalai cake fusions in the mason jar.”

7 Steps to make your own salad jar



In the base, add the dressing to the mason jar, so that the rest of the ingredients do not get soggy.
Second, add the grains or a protein like quinoa or egg.
Follow this with chopped veggies like carrots, cucumbers, zucchini or even pulses like chickpea and mung.
Softer veggies like tomatoes and avocado are added on top so they stay better.
Now, add seeds like roast pumpkin and chia as well as nuts like walnuts.
Let your leafy greens be added last with a sprinkling of herbs if you like.
When you are about to eat, give the jar a shake to evenly spread the dressing in the jar."

,"Created: Jan 10, 2020, 00:00 IST",TV,I am inspired by CM Jagan Mohan Reddy: Veerandra Chowdhary,"Actor, producer and Namitha’s husband Veerandra Chowdhary has made his television debut with Uyire, in which he is playing the lead. “I really wasn’t keen on working in television serials. But, when I heard the script of Uyire, I was fascinated and watched all the episodes of its Hindi version (Choti Sarrdaarni), which was quite impressive. So, I decided to take this up,” he says.

Veera plays Sezhiyan, a politician, in the serial. He elaborates, “Sezhiyan is different from other politicians we see in films or television. More than a politician, he is someone who lives for his family. He is kind, well-behaved and cares for people around him. The character I play in this serial is 80 per cent similar to me in real life. I’m inspired by CM of Andhra Pradesh, Jagan Mohan Reddy. In fact, he is a role model for me for this particular role. I watch his speeches.”

So, how has the experience been like? “I hail from a political background. I can say that politics is in my blood. I’ve seen people discussing politics every day. From day one of shoot, I adapted the characteristics of Sezhiyan. So, it is not tough for me to work on it,” he says.


Meanwhile, the actor is also doing a Telugu show and two films in Tamil, directed by T Rajhendherr and Yezhumalai respectively. Ask him how he plans to juggle both TV and films, and Veera says, “Television is a long-term commitment. The audience will see you on a daily basis and you will become one among them. But I’ll continue to do films and also take up serials. I don’t feel it’s a burden because I enjoy balancing both.”"
"Created: Jan 10, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,I was worried I’d fall and push Vijay to the ground: Bhumika Chawla,"My tryst with modelling began when I’d done a print ad for a computer brand. I used to go for auditions and soon landed the opportunity to do a few TVCs — including a beauty brand and a jewellery brand. I think people started noticing me, and I was cast in the music video, Masoom Tera Chehra. It was by Kumar Sanu, and we’d shot at a farm in Panvel, Mumbai. In the interim, I continued to do more ads. One of them — for a toffee brand — was shot by Priyadarshan in Switzerland. I was both nervous and excited about travelling abroad alone for the first time. In a way, that ad was also a life-changer because the makers of Yuvakudu saw me in that and called me for a screen test. They held a test twice in Mumbai and I missed it both the times. So, I was called to Annapurna Studios.

It was September 6, 1996, and I was on my first trip alone to Hyderabad. I didn’t know what to expect, and went with the attitude that ‘If the movie clicks, good, and if not, I at least get to travel to Hyderabad’. But I guess that film was in my destiny. One thing led to another, and the makers of Badri saw me in my Telugu film and signed me on. It was a wonderful experience, working with Vijay and director Arun. I don’t exactly remember my first shot for the film, but I do remember this particular shot I gave for the song Kadhal Solvadhu.


We were shooting in Switzerland, and for a particular shot, I had to climb on Vijay’s back. I was nervous and worried that I would fall and also push him to the ground. But luckily, no such thing happened (laughs)! Vijay is a good co-star to work with, very humble and always willing to help. During that schedule, he was talking to me about his film, Kushi, and how he liked the way it had turned out, but was also nervous about its release. Little did I think then that in the time to come, I would be a part of its Telugu remake! Like I said, one good thing led to another, the makers of Tere Naam (Hindi remake of Sethu) had seen me in Kushi and cast me in the Hindi film. The production house was the one I worked with for the toffee ad I shot with Priyadarshan. Life had come a full circle at that point, and I can’t stop thinking how kind God has been to me!"

First, it was Vani Bhojan who was supposed to play the lead. Later, she had to opt out and Sharanya Turadi stepped in. And now, the filmmaker, who made the acclaimed My Son Is Gay, has roped in Airaa girl Gabrella Sellus to play the lead in this thriller, which is set in Kasimedu.

Ask him about these frequent changes and Lokesh says, “When it is an independent film, the actors need to give a considerable amount of time for the film. Like Vani, Sharanya, too, had to opt out owing to date issues. We eventually roped in Gabrella, who played young Nayanthara in Airaa. She is a mime artiste and I have seen one of her short films. I thought I should launch her as a lead actor after seeing her acting prowess. She also does a lot of social awareness videos through her social media account.”


However, his other principal cast — Michael Thangadurai, Pragya Nagra and Anupama Kumar — are very much part of the film, adds Lokesh, who has finished shooting for the film. The filmmaker has also roped in YouTuber Subhalaxmi Parida, who plays a comical role as a fisherwoman. Akshay Kamal, who is acting in the TV serial Rettai Roja, will also be seen in a crucial role. “Akshay plays Pragya’s pair in the film, while Michael and Gabrella play another couple. There are over 10 new faces in this film,” says the director.

The team is currently busy with the post production work and Lokesh says he is hopeful of getting the film released by mid-2020."
"Created: Jan 10, 2020, 00:00 IST",Hansy Sanctis,Entertainment,The Amithias Project to debut in Bengaluru this month,"A decade-long Indo-German friendship has translated into a musical collaboration, called The Amithias Project. The ensemble — led by Indian flautist Amith Nadig and Germany’s Matthias Schriefl, who plays the trumpet and flugal horn — is ready for its first-ever concert in Bengaluru later this month. The other members of the band are Vinod Shyam Anoor (on mridangam), Sunaad Anoor (on kanjira) and Bharatanatyam dancer Nivedita Sharma. Amith first met Matthias in Bengaluru, in 2009. The latter used to visit India annually to learn the nuances of Carnatic music. Eventually, the two artistes connected over their passion for Indian classical music. “I was happy to meet a person who understood our country’s music so well. Matthias also made an effort to know me as a musician. This bond, in turn, helped us work together. From being inspired by Indian classical music to working on German folk music and jazz elements, we felt like we were breaking barriers through our music,” says Amith.

The duo worked together for a long time before deciding to collaborate. “Most of our original compositions are based on the kind of experiences we share. For example, we have a song, titled Roaming Bangalore, which was conceived when Matthias and I were enjoying some local street food in the city. The spicy food, walking around the city streets and interacting with local people inspired Matthias to write the song,” says Amith.

Explaining about the Bharatanatyam element in the collaboration, Amith says, “It all began when my wife Niveditha danced along when we were jamming. The way her dance steps matched our tunes without any practice enabled us to add this new dimension to our project. And the rest of the elements fell in place almost immediately. We both agree that percussion played a big role in bringing our music together,” Amith sums up."

While the day is celebrated on November 1 every year, Upendra firmly believes that Kannadigas, and everyone who lives in Karnataka, should start the year with Kannada. Meanwhile, the actor, who has been the founder of a political party over the last few years, tells us as a matter of fact, “I do not want to be a politician, I will not contest elections, and I am not interested in any kind of position in the government.” What then is this concept that he has been propagating so passionately in all his free time? Excerpts…

What was the purpose of your Karnataka Rajyotsava wish on the first of January?
It was a sincere attempt to see if we can begin the new year with Kannada. November 1 is when we celebrate Karnataka Rajyotsava, but rather than restricting celebrations to just that day, we should aim at becoming number 1 Kannadigas. Keeping that in mind, I wished people for a year full of Kannada — whether it is speaking the language or teaching others to speak it, or just celebrating our culture. There are a lot of people around who know the language, but hesitate to speak it, probably because they worry they might make grammatical mistakes. If we refrain from poking fun at their attempts, and encourage them, instead, a lot more may start speaking Kannada.


After you floated the Uttama Prajakeeya Party, common perception was that you would contest elections, but you didn’t.
I floated this party for a different purpose. Once someone floats a political party, it is assumed that the person intends to pursue a career as a politician. We need to break that mindset. I am not interested in contesting elections or being a politician. I am a citizen of this country, and in my capacity, I am doing my bit to bring about a change. What I have done is to create a platform — something that not everybody can do. The intention is to inculcate the ideology behind this concept.
What is the concept, then?
The main purpose is to hand over power, of change, and to bring in change, to people. For instance, if I have the power, there are more chances of me becoming corrupt. I should not have that kind of power. With the technology that we have today, we can bring about progressive and positive changes at the micro level. For instance, we have introduced a process called the Standard Operating Procedure — by which those who join the party are introduced to the process of connecting with people and understanding their needs and demands. After that, they have to work out how to meet those demands in the best way possible through discussions with experts in the areas concerned, put out this plan to the people and explain the way forward. People should be able to see and decide which of these solutions work best for them. The solutions must then be executed according to set timelines with complete transparency of the system. Today, we have the block-chain technology, which assures you of transparency at all levels. In the end, a poll should be conducted on whether the job was done well or not. If it was good, then the person should be allowed to continue functioning and, if not, he/she must resign. If this procedure is followed in every aspect of governance, the city is bound to grow. Earlier, people used vote for a particular political party, which then changed and became about the individual contesting elections. What I am asking for here is for people to go a step further — look at the issues they are facing and see who has the best ideas and the process to fix them; and then, vote for them.

Where do you see a hitch here?
People have this need to follow a leader; someone who will take charge and fix their lives. This expectation is based on a myth. It is wrong to wait for someone to bring in change. You should be the change; get involved. The issue is also that politics is a business. If I have spent crores of rupees on election campaigns and won, I will look at earning more out of it. Why will I bother about bringing in transparency in the way I function after that? I want people to not treat this like a business. The government allots about `10,000 crores as a budget for the 198 wards that we have here. So, one ward gets approximately `50 crore. In five years, each ward, therefore, gets `250 crore. Imagine the changes you can bring about with that kind of money. But if we make that a personal business, where you need to recover money spent on getting yourself elected, then, where is the scope for development or change? Unfortunately, it is a situational issue, because people believe they cannot win an election without investing money. I’m not blaming anyone here. I am looking at accountability. If my film is not good, it is thrown out of the theatres. In any other profession too, if you do not do your job well, you are fired. That does not hold good for politicians.

Do you see any change in the way people think, from the time you have begun speaking about this concept?
I have great faith in the youngsters of our country — they are demanding change. Politicians give people a manifesto — a list of promises of changes they will bring about. But they don’t do anything. If there is no legal binding for a manifesto, there is no accountability. If I have given a manifesto, it should be registered in a court of law; and if I have not delivered, I should not remain in that position. That does not happen. So, let’s not have a manifesto at all. Let the manifesto be based on what people need. For instance, if I am a leader, I decide what the people around me need. But what I think may not be what they need. An individual gets involved in what concerns him, be it his immediate environment, his kid’s school or traffic jams around his place. Similarly, if an individual gets involved with what concerns society, then he can bring in a difference. In that sense, I think there has been a change. We may not be able to see it right now, because there is no ‘show and tell’ that people are used to seeing. But it is taking place at micro levels. I am trying and people are supporting this with a certain amount of honesty. When I visit colleges, and speak about these ideas to students, they tell me, ‘If you contest elections, we will vote for you’. That is not the point here; it is not up to me to be a leader. It is up to each individual to bring in change. I see the change taking place, a future in which elections are not about a political party, but are based on issues and solutions. It will happen.

Do you feel you have succeeded?
This is not about success of failure. I am doing this for my own satisfaction. Many people have advised me to change my strategy, to collect funds and go on processions across the state. Now, if I start travelling all over the state, I will only have people taking selfies with me. There will be no real impact and people will not understand the concept that I am trying to drive. See, when you are offered a drink, you welcome it. When you are offered medicine, you don’t like it much. In such a scenario, what I am advising here is ayurvedic medicine, which takes time before one can see results. One day, when the issues are way too much to handle, you will have to get back here and attend to the root cause of the problem.


What are the issues to focus on?
Education and health are two areas that are extremely important — there is a definite need for attention here. Apart from these, take the example of how drip irrigation was introduced in areas that have water scarcity – each plant gets the right amount of water, while ensuring no water goes waste. Right now, despite the burgeoning population in our country, the budgets allocated for these numbers are on the decline. We need ways to address the needs of people, in spite of the economic challenges that we are faced with.


Citizens are standing up for causes, especially when they are pushed to the limit. What is your take on this?
Electing the wrong person and protesting after that is foolish. Do not let corruption get the better of you on the voting day and do not look at who is giving you more money, or which caste or religion a candidate belongs to. If you are swayed by factors that do not matter, where is democracy? Vote for ideology. What is government service all about? Should they not work towards ensuring that people do not have to protest? Everybody knows what is happening is wrong, but that does not mean we accept it like helpless people. When you know something is wrong, change it. There is no point in cribbing about which leader is to blame for what went wrong. There are issues, and they will keep cropping up. One issue crops up, people hold protests and polls, and try to change that. By the time you highlight one issue, there is already another that you need to address and hold protests about. That is the difference in ‘Prajakeeya’ and ‘Rajakeeya’. Rajakeeya is one person saying, ‘I know everything, except what people want’. Prajakeeya is about knowing only that what people say they want.

How much of your daily schedule is dedicated to your party, since you are busy with film commitments as well?
People have asked me why I make appearances on the political front only during elections. But that is how it should be. I have my job, which I need to attend to. And there are politicians who have been elected, who have a job as well. They need to be answerable to all the promises they have made. It’s like hiring a driver and paying him for his job, but still asking another driver to come in and have him do the same job to see if I should hire the second one or not.


What is the immediate change that the government should be making?
Irrespective of which party makes up the government, people have always had issues with the way it functions. The bigger issue here is that we, as individuals, need to correct ourselves. Take, for the Swachh Bharat Mission. Do we, as individuals, keep our surroundings clean? We don’t follow the basic step, but don’t think twice about commenting on whether the government is doing its bit about it or not. What someone else does is secondary; first we need to look at whether you and I, as individuals, are doing the right thing. There is so much hatred. If I hate another religion, someone else will hate my religion too. But is that what we are as a country? The beauty of India is the unity we have in diversity, isn’t it?"

The students wanted them to pull down the banners, and refused to be forced to sign the said petition. The video, which went viral on social media by the evening of January 8, 2020, shows the girls also being questioned on their patriotism, and threatened for speaking up — and allegedly even stating that the college will see a recap of what happened at Delhi’s JNU and Jamia Milia. Bengaluru’s student population, which has until now been restrained from voicing out political opinions, took to social media to protest this latest development.

A day later, on January 9, 2020, when the students of JNC set out to hold a protest against the incidents of the day before, they were forced to stop two minutes after they began their peaceful protest. A student from the college informed us, “I do not know what is happening. We have been asked not to leave the campus; authorities have asked all students to remain indoors.” Teachers and college authorities refrained from commenting at the time of going to press. “We have been asked not to divulge any details until further notice,” said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

Over a quick chat with us, the composer, who was in Madurai on Thursday, clarified on the confusion around Valimai’s music director. “Work is going on for the music of Ajith’s Valimai,” he said, but when we prodded further, he added, “That said, any updates regarding the songs in the film will have to come from the film’s production team.” Yuvan had composed the music of Ajith and Vinoth’s previous film Nerkonda Paarvai as well, and had been mentioned as the composer in the official press release of Valimai. However, a few media reports that cropped up in late December 2019 claimed that he had been replaced by D Imman.

Interestingly, Yuvan has also ventured into composing music for a commercial for the first time in his over two-decade-old career. The commercial is directed by Sangili Bungili Kadhava Thorae fame Ike Radha.

“I love to explore everything in music and composing for a short ad film is a different experience. Ike and I are school friends from the fourth standard and it was fun working with him,” he said. The composer also mentioned that he’s keen to do more live concerts in the coming days."

Talking to us about the relevance of the title, Sathya says, “Puravi in Tamil means horse. And we all know that horse is always associated with speed and power. The central character in the film (played by Sakshi) is as powerful as a horse. She is always motivated and her focus doesn’t deviate, no matter what the situation. She achieves what she sets out to, and will never give up. So, we thought this was an apt title for the film.”


The shoot was slated to begin from January. However, the latest is that the team will start filming from February. “Sakshi is training under Pandian master. She needed some more time to prepare as doesn’t want to use a body double for the stunt sequences. We are also finalising the rest of the cast and crew,” says Sathya.

Ask Sakshi about her training and she says, “I’m back from my vacation and I’ll resume my training soon. I’m currently training in silambam and will soon learn other martial art forms, too.”"

It’s not limited to one theme or issue or gender. It’s about speaking up and confronting.”

Shashaa has composed the song and written the lyrics of the Hindi version. “It’s a duet, sung by me and Chinmayi. We feature in the video as well, which will be released next week. The point was to cater to our audiences, who speak both Tamil and Hindi, and to spread the message, considering it’s a crucial one,” she adds.


Ask Chinmayi how she came to associate with the song and she says, “Shashaa sent me the work about two-three months ago and asked me what I thought of it. She then asked me if I could sing it for her. She’s pretty serious about writing, arranging and composing, and has done a good job. We recorded the song in the second week of December.”

Shashaa chips in, “Chinmayi was a dream to work with. I’ve idolised her for over a decade and to be able to collaborate on a song with her was absolutely surreal. She was patient, supportive and cooperative and unbelievably easy to work with, no tantrums or air, all for which my respect for her has grown multifold.”"

Actor Roshan Mathew has hit the purple patch and came into the limelight by making the gentle Amir a memorable character that Mollywood can always cherish.
At his home in Kakkanad, Roshan looks a bit exhausted. He rushes in after winding up some pending work, apologises for being late and keeping us waiting. “I am caught up with preparing for a couple of movies which are expected to begin next month,” he explains, making himself comfortable on the sofa. The actor who debuted in Malayalam through Adi Kapiyare Kootamani and became popular through Anandam, is also known for his theatre production A Very Normal Family (AVNF). “We are working on our second play now. I am doing a performance-based story. Life is busy,” he goes on as we listen in…

How is life after Moothon?


It was the most satisfying acting and life experience. Firstly, it was a project that brought together many people I craved to work with. On top of that, Amir was easily the best written character I got to play. I have always considered myself lucky to be an actor who got to play characters that are distinct from each other. Amir was very interesting and full of love. All I did was to do justice to what Geetu (Mohandas) had written.
The energy I found on the sets of Moothon is something that I now long for at every set. With a lot of positivity around, all you want to do is give your best.

In our recent interview with Nivin Pauly, he said many had told him to be ready for a backlash after playing a homosexual. How were things at your end?

Honestly, I had no second thoughts. Anything Geetu offered, I would have taken. So, there was no moment when I had thought negatively about Amir. I never thought of reactions from society. If Nivin, who has a lot more to lose than me, wasn't scared, why should I be?



Some from the LGBTQIA+ community raised concerns that Moothon did not reflect the current travails of the community. Some also said it hasn’t served gender justice.

I'm not aware of this sentiment as it hasn't reached me or anyone from the team of Moothon. I do not know if I am qualified to say if the film has done justice as I am not from the community. At the end of the day, I am an outsider who is trying to understand and learn about the community. It is a process; a self-taught process. But in terms of representation, and separating myself from the film, I think it has been closest to a realistic and sensitive effort at portraying characters or telling a story from that community, as far as Malayalam cinema is concerned. Now, how the story ends or how the movie itself ends I think, is the perogative of Geetu, as director-writer.

Geetu has the licence to tell the story that she wants to tell, rather than be caught up with trying to be too politically correct at every step. I think every filmmaker has that right, while they still have a responsibility to be sensitive to the issues they deal with and towards the truth. At the end of the day, we need to recognise that you are handling a form of art which influences a lot of people.

Like in Bollywood, you too have been balancing theatre with films…

I started my tryst with acting through theatre. Films happened when I had, not even in my wildest dreams, imagined doing it. I didn't think films were accessible to someone with no family background in cinema or someone who doesn't have a godfather.

I started doing theatre at a very early age and decided that it would be something I’d do for life. I even thought I would make my living out of theatre. When I went to Mumbai, while learning theatre, I realised that it is probably going to be impossible to make a living out of theatre and started auditioning for web series, ad films, films and what not. Then out of nowhere, offers started coming my way for Malayalam movies. I did films for two years, and then realised that I really miss theatre. I got in touch with a couple of people in Kochi whom I knew used to do theatre. We started small with friends and unexpectedly, organically, it began to grow into a professional theatre production.

We thought Kochi doesn't have a theatre culture, so why don’t we start one, as it has all the ingredients that Mumbai has. We too have artistes who have come in from all parts of the country to the film industry. A lot of people are waiting for good work and a keen audience. The only thing we lack is performance spaces and I guess those too are coming up now at a healthy rate. We will try our best to kickstart the culture. If it doesn't happen now, it will definitely happen 10 or 20 years from now.
AVNF, despite not being a great play as compared to some of the great productions that is happening in the country, ran to seven full house shows. We tried really hard to make the best play as possible with the available resources.

Do you think that the response has something to do with the film background of the AVNF team?

Of course. If it didn't have the names that it did, would people have come to watch the show? Probably not. But the only positive side we saw, and which makes us keep going, is that all through the seven shows, we saw people walk up to all of us and talk about the play rather than ask for a selfie. So, even if people were coming in to watch moderately popular film actors 10 metres away, we somehow managed to entertain for more than 40 minutes and make them say, ‘Hey, we never knew theatre could be this’.



The second production we have doesn't have anyone from films. If it doesn't go well, we will know that we got an audience earlier because we were film actors.

Did you feel AVNF was restrained to a certain class? Shouldn’t it be accessible to all?

I don't really know what it is about a play that restricts it to a certain economic class, apart from the ticket price. We tried to make AVNF shows as democratic as possible. We performed our opening show at Nishagandi in Thiruvananthapuram, though the space wasn't conducive to our performance. In Kochi, the venues called for a higher expense and so tickets were priced in a way that allowed us to at least break even. Ten years ago, while I was in Mumbai or Chennai, even I couldn't go for the shows because it was expensive. I felt terrible to know the same was happening here.

The only way to get out of this is by having sponsors, which isn’t easy in Kochi, because investors are looking for returns. This is something everyone in theatre has to go through until we get where Mumbai is right now. There is a certain amount of money running in the theatre circle and venues which are affordable. These are the struggles while starting off in a place with no theatre culture.

We know those who came for our show were mostly our social media followers. It is not ideal to give up on that privilege and say, ‘we will be just like our predecessors who functioned in an ideal way out of love for theatre’, and end up losing hope. I think, better be practical. Maybe eventually, we will be able to make it more democratic.

You made your Bollywood debut through Choked, an Anurag Kashyap directorial. Tell us about that.


Choked is about two people suffocating in a marriage. Anurag Kashyap is a very exciting person to work with. He is big on improvisation. He likes to see what happens in the moment. There are very few boundaries when you work with him. It is always fun to work with a team that you completely trust because you just focus on what you are going to do. You can explore.


What are your next projects?


There are three movies awaiting release. One is Sidharth Siva’s movie with Parvathy, the second one is Kappela with Anna Ben and Sreenath Bhasi, directed by Muhammad Musthafa, and the third is Pennum Cherukkanum helmed by Aashiq Abu based on Unni R’s short story, which is part of an anthology."
"Updated: Jan 13, 2020, 16:36 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,Mayank Agarwal: My goal is to win World Cups and championships,"Mayank Agarwal has become the new poster-boy of Indian Test cricket, with him being one of the top scorers in the format last year and finishing as India’s highest test run getter for the season. Getting there, though, has not been easy; he’s had a long, hard wait of almost a decade, showing just how consistent his work is. Despite all the on-field feats, Mayank is not as flamboyant off it, compared to a lot of his compatriots, preferring to let his work do the talking. We caught up with the elusive cricketer on a sunny morning, right after a practice session. 2019 has been a significant year for you, with you being India’s highest run scorer in the test format. What has been your biggest takeaway from the year?
The year has been about a lot of experience, as far as playing international cricket goes. It has been great. India being on top of the Test championships has also been a great feel good factor. The experiences and spending time in the Indian dressing room were great.
You surpassed a feat held for long by Sir Don Bradman, when you scored a second double century in quick succession. Did you see that coming?

(Laughs) I definitely did not. For me, it is about going out there and playing for the country and doing the best I can while contributing to a win. Records will come and go; that will always take a backseat for me. Winning and contributing to the team’s success is my priority.
Which was your favourite innings from 2019? I can’t point out one favourite innings. The year started off well with the Sydney Test and with us winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. There was no better way to start 2019, as team India. Following this, I got to score double hundreds, so it has all been memorable.
What do you have in mind for the tour of New Zealand that’s lined up ahead?
There has been a lot of preparation for the tournament. I am going to be playing India A games and then will be a part of the Test series. I have really been looking forward to it. I watched New Zealand play Australia and understand how their bowling works. Hopefully, we can go there and win. The more we win abroad, the more confident we are and the better we feel.
You’re a bonafide Test player in this T20 era. What’s your mindset like?
To be honest, as a player, you know that Test cricket is the ultimate form of the game. T20 does challenge you in some ways, but Test cricket is way different. Since it is played over five days, it challenges one in different ways. It is alright to not have a good day, as you can still make a comeback — that is the thrill. It is not enough to have just one good day to win the match. You have to play well over the period of 4-5 days to win the game. Having said that, from the time I began, all I cared about was representing India and playing all formats of the game.
You’ve been a consistent performer in the Ranji Trophy games. How important are domestic tournaments in a cricket-crazy nation like India, where many vie for a spot in the team?
Domestic cricket is very important, because it sets us up when we go and play for India at the international level. The Indian domestic circuit is not easy at all, because we have a long season and we play a lot of matches. With India being a very big country, we play a lot of games in different parts. This gives us experiences to understand what we can do when we are put in different situations. If a player can go through that, then he is obviously better equipped to play international cricket.
Have you set goals for yourself when it comes to being a part of team India, now that you seem to be cementing a place there?
It is a team sport, so the goal for me, always, is to win championships, World Cups and other tournaments. This remains my first and foremost goal. From there, I would like to contribute in the best possible manner for the country.
You’ve seen setbacks too in your career, with your wait being long before getting to wear the national team jersey. What is the mantra that has kept you going?
Something that I always looked forward to, when I began playing cricket as a kid, was to play for the country. I understand, that as a sportsman, you go through ups and downs. It is important to understand what you want to become and then be persistent towards achieving it. Give it all, till you’ve had enough. Setbacks are also important because you understand yourself and get to know how motivated and passionate you are and how desperately you want to achieve your dreams.
What’s your bond like with your teammates?
If you ask me, we players in a team are more like a family because we spend more time with each other than with our families. For, me it is just that. I treat them like how I’d treat members in my family.
You’re a shy person by nature, but your father-in-law (top cop Praveen Sood) is a popular name in city social circles. Has he ever asked you to accompany him?

I share a great bond with him. We sit and laugh over a lot of things. But he understands me as a person. We keep our professional and personal lives separate. So, it is not necessary that I accompany him when he steps out, and he is not compelled to ask me to. I guess that’s how our equation is.

Being visible is important for any celebrity in today’s world. But you remain under the radar mostly.

I believe that not everything you do or have has to be for public consumption. You can silently do your own stuff and keep moving forward. At the end of the day, it is your dream and your life. All that you want to do is achieve your dream and move on. So, I take the spiritual route for the matter.

How did spirituality come into the picture?

(Laughs) Funnily, when I was 18, my father asked me to accompany him for a vipassana course. Like any 18-year-old, I was reluctant and not interested. It was only when he insisted that it would help my game that I agreed to accompany him. Eventually, what I experienced in those 12 days was spectacular. I took to it since then and have stuck to it.

How does that fit into your training routine?

Meditation helps you get a good understanding about your frame of mind. You also get to understand the kind of person you are. So, that really helps you in your game, because you know the lines that you have to stick to or the boundaries that you do not have to cross. Every meditation session that you go to is different, so I relate that to a match. Things aren’t the same every time you step out to play a match; you have to be patient, persistent and keep focusing on what will help you."

"Created: Jan 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,"More than a remake, our movie will be a retelling of Vicky Donor","Harish Kalyan and Tanya Hope have come together for the Tamil remake of Vicky Donor, titled Dharala Prabhu. The film is directed by Krishna Marimuthu, and the debutant director says that “more than a remake, our film will be a retelling of Vicky Donor”.
“I’m a big fan of the original so when I got the offer to direct this film, I asked for some time to work on the script. It needed to be adapted to today’s times, and there are things in the film that might not have suited our audiences. We have made some major changes,” he says. While the original was a cross-cultural romance between a Punjabi boy and a Bengali girl, this one will be between a Tamil boy and a girl from Karnataka. But apart from the localisation, he has also modified the characters to suit the personality of the actors playing them.

Elaborates Karthik, “Ayushmann Khurrana’s character was somewhat loud and boastful in the original, but here, Harish’s will be more grounded. He is a boy from a family hailing from Tanjore, and he is more subdued as a person. And while Ayushmann had a carefree attitude, Harish will be a more responsible guy… someone more sorted in life.”
Tanya’s character will be a woman of today — independent, confident, and self-supporting.

The one character that he hasn’t made many changes to is that of the doctor, played by Annu Kapoor in the original and Vivekh in this film.


“It is the soul of the film. This is the character that explains a subject considered taboo in our society to the audience and ensures that it is something that has to be discussed, so I’ve retained it as such,” says Krishna, but adds that Vivekh has brought in his own qualities to the role.


“He is known for the social work he does. While he is amazing at comedy, he also manages to make us take note of the messages he gives through them, without making them heavy-handed. And that is essential for this role,” he says.


Selvakumar, who has shot films like Maanagaram, Mehandi Circus and Gypsy, is the cinematographer of this film while Sathish Surya of Irudhi Suttru and Soorarai Pottru fame is the editor. The music director, he says, will be a surprise. “All I can say for now is that we are trying something new,” he teases."
,"Created: Jan 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",Entertainment,"Asif Ali, Sunny Wayne in Rajeev Ravi’s police thriller","Asif Ali, who has had a career-defining year in 2019, will kick off this year with a bang, literally. The actor will be playing a cop in Rajeev Ravi’s upcoming directorial, after Thuramukham.

Asif tell us, “It’s a movie that I am really excited about. We are hoping to start filming this month itself. It’s a police survival story and will be shot extensively in North India.”


Apart from Asif, the movie also stars Sunny Wayne, Alencier Ley Lopez, Sharafudheen and Manikandan Achari. While Rajeev Ravi’s last two movies – Thuramukham and Kammattipaadam – had period settings, the filmmaker tells us, “The upcoming film is based on a real-life incident and is a crime and punishment story set in the contemporary era. We are planning to start the shoot after January 15. Apart from North India, we will also be shooting a few portions in Kerala.”

Meanwhile, Rajeev has wrapped up the filming of Thuramukham, which is set in the 30s and 40s, and revolves around the coastal community. The film, which has Nivin Pauly, Indrajith and Nimisha Sajayan in the lead, is expected to hit theatres soon."

Jayasurya’s Thrissur Pooram, for which he wrote the script, hit the theatres at the end of December and his tracks for the movie and Anoop Menon’s King Fish have been vying with each other for the pole position in music charts. The music director talks about his milestones so far and what to look forward to.
How was it scripting a film for the first time?

It was an idea I had for several years. We had planned to start it a few years ago but it got delayed, and we could begin production only last year. For me, movies are a craze and I spent a lot of time developing the script. I would imagine how each scene would play out on the screen along with the music, and I would space out the dialogues accordingly. As a musician, I could figure out easily how music would influence the scenes.


Was there a point where you got over-indulgent in terms of the impact of music?
Not really. The priority was always the emotions that were conveyed by the characters. The music only accentuated that. For instance, when there are a few seconds of silence between the dialogues, as a scriptwriter and composer I know what the pause should convey. I believe all good musicians have a sense of story because only then they can convey the emotions through their music.

What went into creating a mass hero like Pullu Giri?

The entire film is told through Jayaettan’s character and what he goes through. Throughout his life, he has had losses and he has been lonely. And then when he finds love, I have tried to make the character enjoy that phase in his life. Every person in our society, irrespective of their virtues or vices, is chasing happiness and that is true in Giri’s case too. In the film, I have built him as a man with virtues but due to certain unforeseen circumstances, he gets entangled in troubles.

Have melodies always been your forte?

I don’t believe in sticking to a particular kind of music. The film I have scripted has a lot of action scenes and thrilling moments. So, I don’t want to limit myself. But it’s true that I have got more opportunities to compose melodies and that’s why they have been noticed. Last year too, that was the case. Going forward, it could change.


Apart from Jayasurya, every time you have also teamed up with Anoop Menon, there have been hit songs. This was the case in Beautiful, Namukku Parkkaan and most recently in King Fish.

We released En Ramazhayil, a track from King Fish, a few months ago and Anoopettan, who was in Dubai then, shared a video of him playing the song in his car. After that, many Malayalis all over the world started playing the song while they were travelling and shared videos of it on social media. It was a huge appreciation for us. The song is written by Anoopettan, who is also making his directorial debut with the film. So, it’s special. It was a coincidence that this song was overtaken in the charts by Thrissur Pooram’s Sakhiyee, which was again composed by me and the whole song’s situation was created by me. I like to think that was a milestone in my career.


What can the audience look forward to from you this year?


I am set to publish a book and if a good subject comes to mind, I will definitely work on a script too. The focus this year though would be composing. I have a project each in Tamil and Telugu that I will start work on soon. In addition, I have a couple of films in Malayalam."
"Created: Jan 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,Music Review: Pattas,"The soundtrack of Vivek-Mervin’s Pattas lines up a crisp list of five songs. The album begins with the electric Chill Bro, rendered in Dhanush’s characteristic timbre. Playing up the film’s catchphrase, Chill Bro, the fast-paced song chronicles the light-heartedness of the film’s hero.

Jigidi Killaadi, by Anirudh Ravichander, is a romantic solo. While the lyrics typically compare the woman in attention to arbitrary things like “lemon mint cooler” and “padam ootum theatre”, Vivek-Mervin’s catchy tune is hummable.

Pudhi Suriyan plays out like a sweet lullaby in Anuradha Sriram’s rendition. The mild keys compliment her voice, further amplifying the mother’s love for her newborn, as suggested by the lyrics.


Morattu Thamizhan Da is exactly what its title suggests. The almost four-minute number is loud, explosive, and never once loses its note, keeping us hooked to its beats. Vivek’s earthy lyrics evokes imageries of Tamil icons Bharatiyar and Kattabomman.

Piriyadha Enna is a sweet-sounding ballad rendered by Vijay Yesudas and Niranjana. The song, which is reminiscent of an old-fashioned romance, is definitely one of the album’s highpoints."

Sathish shares, “A large set is being erected, and the song, composed by Judah Sandhy and Karthik, will introduce the hero’s character. The composition is power-packed, so the choreography will be challenging. I’ll have to sustain the energy and bring in that heroism factor. I’m going to give it my all — I hope it shapes up well,” shares Sathish, adding, “We have shot for this movie all over India, and hence, have dedicated a lot of time to this project. The film sees me in three different avatars.”"
"Created: Jan 11, 2020, 00:11 IST",Purnima Sah,Entertainment,'When Chai Met Toast' to release their first album this year,"It’s the silver jubilee edition of IIT Madras’s annual cultural fest, Saarang, which will feature the band ‘When Chai Met Toast’. The four-piece band — Achyuth Jaigopal, Palee Francis, Ashwin Gopakumar and Sailesh Pai — can’t wait to be on the stage already.
Begins Ashwin Gopakumar, “When we were in college, Saarang was one of those headliner events that brought international acts and students would look forward to being there, and that’s something they still do. Watching the bands whom we grew up listening to was a big deal. And from that point onwards, it was the stage that we always wanted to play. Coming here as a band is going to be nostalgic. Well, at least for Achyuth and I as we both have played earlier as part of other bands.”
Not many know that Achyuth and Ashwin are also half Tamilians and have done their schooling at Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music.


The year has begun on a busy note for the band as they are working towards releasing their first album, this year. “For the first time in four years, we are writing our full-length album, which will have eight to nine songs in it. We began the recording two days ago in a studio based in Mumbai and Kochi. The song-writing process is going on. We are also planning to shoot the videos for the album, which is likely to begin in March. It’s been a year since we started working on the album. I can’t reveal the title (of the album) now, but I can tell you that it’s going to be in the form of an anthology that talks about love and happiness,” informs Ashwin.

The musician also informs that there will new musical instruments and new voices, too, in the album. Ashwin adds, “We are experimenting a lot. There is a song without an acoustic guitar... a song with just ukulele... collaborations with other artistes, too. You can also expect a song either in Tamil or Hindi. Like always, we will have songs in English with a few phrases in Tamil and Hindi in the songs. We plan to release the album in the first half of 2020.”


Coming from a generation that grew up listening to albums, Ashwin says it’s quite a benchmark for all of them to be able to do this. “As a band, we have released singles and EPs. It’s easier to promote a single, but promoting each song from an album will be challenging and we are looking forward to experiencing that too.”


Talking about how online streaming platforms have broadened the horizon to grow for independent music, Ashwin says it’s the best time for all the musicians to put up their work that reaches ears across the globe."

SEE ALL",,Lifestyle,Why you must keep your mitochondria healthy,"You can buy all the creams, pills and medicines in the world but if your mitochondria (known as the powerhouses of the cell) is not functioning the right way, you will still age rapidly, your skin will look dull, you will put on weight, lose hair, feel tired and be prone to conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Autism, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, dementia, diabetes, Huntington’s disease, migraine and a lot more.

Cellular health
While medicines, creams, pills, and all external aids can be used as a crutch, if you are looking to truly prevent or repair your body – you need to start focusing on cell and cellular health. Take “lack of energy” as an example since it’s something we often complain about. We run behind coffee, tea, energy drinks, sugar, carbs to charge us up forgetting that our body is capable of generating its own energy. Every single cell is just like a battery and has the power to light up a bulb. This is enough energy to get us through a day – be it physical, mental, workouts, digestion, etc. What is the source of this energy? It’s the mitochondria!


It is a component present in each of these trillion cells and that’s where this energy is generated. They are called the powerhouse of the cell as these tiny cellular factories create energy for the whole body. In each of these mitochondria, there are about 18,000- 20,000 assembly lines that take up nutrition and oxygen as raw materials and break it down to a molecule of energy called ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP is the energy currency and without it, we cannot survive. It’s what gives our body to perform all the tasks right from digestion to immune system function. Lesser the number of ATP molecules, weaker is the body; and a weak body is susceptible to all the viruses, bacteria and pathogens. Our immune system derives energy to function and stay strong through ATP as well.
Unfortunately, most of us do not generate the energy our body is capable of producing due to our faulty lifestyle – unhealthy eating, no exercise, lack of sleep, unmanaged stress. Ever felt sleepy and lethargic after a junk meal? Now know it’s because your body has an excess of carbon dioxide in the system. Carbon dioxide makes us feel sleepy, tired and sluggish. This is fatigue caused by junk eating at a cellular level. To add to this, there is an increase in free radicals and that’s closely connected to inflammation – the root cause of most diseases right from diabetes, obesity
to cancer.

So, it’s literally up to us to control inflammation in our body by choosing the right foods so that the mitochondria don’t have to work too hard.

What makes our mitochondria function the right way:
- Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains – are all your cells need to function the right way.
Do not deprive your cell and mitochondria of these essentials just because you want to go on a fad diet. It’s that
simple and there are no short cuts to good health.
- Omega 3 (flaxseeds or fish)
- Dietary fibre in adequate amounts.
- HIIT (high-intensity interval training), strength training
- Say no to sugar, refined flour, and all the junk food.
- More cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)
- Quality sleep because those tiny factories need rest
-Bone broth
- Making lifestyle changes and preventing collateral damage if you are on statins. If you are on a statin, also add a selenium and CoQ10 supplement to preserve mitochondrial health.

Each of us is a composition of trillions of cells in our bodies. We were born from single-cell and now our health depends on the individual health of each and every cell


Other reasons for mitochondrial dysfunction:
- Excess exposure to sunlight and at the wrong time as it could damage cell DNA

- Tobacco consumption and smoking

- Motor skill dysfunction and autism could also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction.

- Diabetes (both type 1 and type 2)

"Created: Jan 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,Do you have an inner makeover urge?,"Do you have an inner makeover urge? January is the best time for it. At the turn of every year — and a decade this time around — we are overwhelmed by the desire to renovate our bodies, our faces, our mind, our ambitions – in short, our lives. You can join a transformation class or have a transformation teacher, but here are some ways you can transform your inner self without asking for help. The ultimate makeover is nothing but a change of mindset. Inculcate some microhabits.
Every morning, ask yourself: How can I change my life today?
Get out of the mindset that you ‘have to get through’ the day. Tell yourself the coming hours are filled with open-ended potential for you to take action that will change your life forever.


How can you do it? Think hard about how you can better your life. Work towards the answers. Getting rejected is no big deal: Every day, reach out to one or two people who you’d like to work with or want in your life, even if you are certain they would have no reason to respond. Take chances because without hope, there’s no glory.

How can you do it? Call people even if you are rejected often. It could be a potential employer, a client, a book agent, a director or a producer etc. You might not hear back at first, but eventually, you will get a response from someone. And you have nothing to lose.

Choose comfort for your future self over comfort right now: If you want to change your life, you need to start considering the needs and wants of your future self over the ones you have right now. Prioritising how you feel and what you want in the moment is what lead you here. Start working on your future self.

How can you do it? Make a list for your future self.

Creative drawing: To make this makeover last long, we have to start from the core and work outwards. Spiritual coach and author of The Only Way Out is Within, Rohini Singh, uses her Zentangle workshops to bring change: “It is an easy-to-learn method of creating beautiful images from repetitive patterns. As an art form it’s fascinating, fun and relaxing. Zentangle increases focus and creativity and provides an increased sense of personal well being,” she says.

How can you do it? Be mindful and make pausing before responding a habit.
The fun quotient: Taking on a fresh project or a new pet, a new sport or club or group, can be the most invigorating thing you can do for yourself. Joining a curling team might not make you look better on the outside, but the camaraderie will go a long way to making you glow. Says psychologist Dr Saloni Singh, “Being in a group, learning something, makes you grow inwards and takes you closer to your dreams.”

How can you do it? Inner makeover has more impact when you join an activity and engage. Never stop exploring.


Listen to your intuition: Your intuition speaks to you every day. Every time you ask yourself a question, your intuition sends you an answer. Our inability to accept those answers make us hold ourselves back. Listen to yourself harder.


How can you do it? Don’t ignore the warnings of the heart and the gut.

Daydreaming... is the key to awakening and developing inner vision. It is a powerful tool that allows you to access your deepest state of consciousness, strengthen it and come through more clearly into your daily life.


How can you do it? Find time to go off on a little adventure. Your eyes can be open or closed. Do something that makes you feel alive. As your daydreams become clearer, your psychic vision will improve too."

SEE ALL","Created: Jan 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",Lifestyle,Make these small changes to stay healthy,"When it comes to most aspects of our lives, we tend to overlook the smaller things and focus on the bigger ones instead. This attitude even carries over to our health. We have the tendency to ignore the tiny things that are affecting our health and only pay attention when something big comes up. But it doesn’t always work that way. The smaller things we’re ignoring could add up and be the cause of the big problem, which is something you would’ve been able to stop much earlier, had you paid attention. So, in an effort to be more cautious of the little things that are messing with your health, here are five things you should pay attention to.
Delayed bedtimes
People who go to sleep late tend to be more stressed out than those who are early sleepers. Those of you who go to bed post-midnight are more susceptible to suffer from negative and stressful thoughts, which in turn, will delay you from sleeping even longer. And the stress, coupled with the lack of sleep, can mess with your body in the long run.

Long commutes
For a lot of people, the commute to college or work can span over an hour or so. And unfortunately, such long commutes daily can adversely affect your health. You are more prone to fatigue and exhaustion, stress and other health issues. While there’s not much we can do about this one — unless a location change is somehow possible — it is important to take this aspect into account when you cannot pinpoint where all your stres tsems from...
Eating the wrong foods

Possibly the worst thing we’re all doing to our body is constantly consuming processed foods, which causes weight gain, messes up your blood sugar and immune system, and can cause heart diseases. Basically, we cannot stress how bad processed foods are for your health, so try and avoid them as much as you can.


Being health obsessed

Whether you’re extreme dieting or exercising like a maniac, in your urge to get fitter, you might actually be putting your body at risk. Quite often, when one gets caught up with fitness and dieting, they tend to push themselves too hard. And this not only results in stress, it can

affect your mood, cause fatigue and stop your body from functioning properly. So the next time you’re trying to get fit, don’t push your body too much because it will do more harm than good. Know your body’s limits.

While the team has already begun the post-production work, it has now been announced that the film will be titled Plan Panni Pannanum. This line made famous by Vadivelu suited the script perfectly, says Badri, adding, “Every character in the film has a plan. They will not even be conversing with each other without a plan. And that’s why we thought this line worked as the title for our movie.”

The team launched the title of the movie in Singapore last evening. Considering that this is a travel film, Badri says that planning is something that he was particular about, too. “Actually, this title works for me, too. We shot the film in 24 locations, with 18 senior artistes in two months’ time. So, I had to have a proper plan in hand. That way, naanga kooda plan panni dhan pannom,” he laughs. The film was shot in many locations in south India and northeast India. Badri informs that they are planning to reveal the first look by next week. “The singles will be released by February,” says Badri."

The actor will marry Megha, his girlfriend of two years, in a rather unique and special manner. “We want to celebrate it in a socially-conscious way, while upholding our ideals of equality and social justice. We will have a court marriage, without any rituals or lavishness. Only our closest circle of friends will be in attendance,” reveals Chetan. The actor adds that there will be a low-key celebration the following day. “On February 2, we will have a Santosha Koota at an ashrama. We are currently renovating the ashrama and improving its infrastructure. Megha and I connect on the same social consciousness issues. At the event, we will celebrate with the elders and underprivileged children at the ashrama. It will be a cultural extravaganza, with tribal culture, vachanas, sufi and folk,” he says.

As for his wife-to-be Megha, who hails from Gwalior, Chetan says, “She was doing social work when I met her five years ago. Later, we decided to take it a little further and got into a relationship. I respect Megha for her passion for equality and social work, as well as her giving nature and hard work. She’s studying to be a human rights lawyer. She’s also learning Kannada, which we both value.”"
"Updated: Jan 14, 2020, 11:52 IST",Nupur Amarnath,Lifestyle,Be a trail blazer,"In his recent article titled “The new workwear: has the suit finally died?” in The Guardian, journalist Richard Godwin laments the death of smart dressing. Now a freelancer, this former wearer of suits and hoarder of ties mentions how he finally took his suit out for a university reunion. He writes: “Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?” Well, till the time the blazer is around, smart dressing is not likely to go away.
Workplace dressing has witnessed a literal loosening up of ties for dress codes. Earlier in 2019, Goldman Sachs — known for spiffily dressed execs — announced a move to a flexible dress code. Even the most formal sectors like finance are taking a cue from the tech companies and following er…suit. Enter: blazers, sports coats or jackets that help you look proper without being ‘propah’. Prem Dewan, retail head of an Italian luxury menswear brand says that with performance and work efficiency placed at a higher pedestal, many companies leave room for comfortable dressing for men and women. “Most millennials have stopped wearing suits and are into comfortable yet well-co-ordinated ensembles. Blazers are now worn with denims. For a formal occasion, people wear blazers with a pocket square and a tie,” he adds.


THE TOP LAYER
Just like the little black dress for women, the blazer is a wardrobe staple for men now. Menswear designer Kunal Anil Tanna says that over the years, blazers have transformed and been reimagined by designers. “What began as a less formal substitute to the suit has become a style statement and a wardrobe necessity,” he adds. Blazers now use various design elements like layered panels, collar styles, mock layered, bomber jacket styles, shackets, trench styles and in a variety of fabrics such as linen, cotton, jacquard, velvet and more. Tanna notes that depending on textures and patterns, there’s a blazer for almost every occasion.

This year, if there’s one blazer style that you have to get, make sure it’s the double-breasted jacket, which has evolved over the last century. Compact, more snug-fitted and most importantly redirected as a single-breasted cut is the new look. Dewan says, “The new slim-cut sits close to the body without being overly restrictive on movement. And the mid-weight material makes it wearable all year round.”



STAND ALONE
Menswear designer Sandeep Gonsalves has noticed men’s interest in personal style peaking. “The younger generation is more fashionable and on point with the ongoing trends and a blazer comes with an advantage of stylistic versatility,” he says.

Gonsalves says that a blazer is definitely one piece of clothing that reflects his personal style. “It is essential for a blazer to be well-fitted for a clean look. If someone wants to upgrade their wardrobe, the best option would be to go for a bespoke blazer as it gives you the liberty to choose from the quality of fabric to the colour, cuts and garment details which will take your look a notch above than a regular off-the-rack blazer,” he adds.

Smart casuals as a trend has picked up. Stylist Harsh Khullar says, “While most blazers can be styled casually, most men keep playing between the classic and the casual. Wear it with a traditional shirt-pants combo, or with a golf T-shirt with denim. A good investment will be a classic one or two-button navy blue or black blazer.” Time to blaze up 2020 style.


BLAZER BASICS
-Opt for a solid colour blazer and team it with chinos, basic white shirt and sneakers for the day. For the night, change your footwear to a formal one like loafers or a lace-up, and add a pocket square. Or add a bow tie or a tie

-One can never go wrong with a well-fitted black blazer

-Understand its functionality. If you have a long commute, opt for a fabric that can endure wear and tear. If you leave your blazer at the office overnight, go for a lighter fabric that is breathable

-Double-breasted style, emergence of prints, lighter hues and textures is trendy

-Blazers in rich fabric like velvet, vibrant and pastel hues and textured fabrics are popular

-Travel blazers are in. These come with features like inbuilt headphone wires, chargers


Over the years the blazer has become a versatile wardrobe essential that goes well with a tuxedo shirt or even a casual T-shirt — Hemant Sagar, designer"
"Created: Jan 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,The rise of ‘Japandi’ style,"For quite sometime now, design sensibilities have had two guiding lights: one from Scandinavia and the other from Japan. Both are known for their minimalistic sensibilities. Now, the two have joined forces to start a design movement that’s taking over the world of interiors by storm. Known as ‘Japandi’, this look takes the modern flair of Scandinavian design and combines it with the timeless elegance of a Japanese aesthetic to create a style that brings together the best of both worlds.
The idea is that people want to make everyday life simple and sustainable – from furniture to tableware to interiors, everything is about clean lines, neutral tones and natural textures. Clean and calm come together in Japandi. Both sensibilities value simplicity and functionality, a love of natural materials, and a deep respect for craftsmanship. Both appreciate things made with hand, made with care and made to last. Both are exercises in minimalism and emphasise on function-driven spaces defined by a handful of statement pieces. According to experts, Japandi is all set to become a design movement, a classic that will be in style for decades. What’s more? It’s an adaptable look that can be dressed up or down to suit your individuality.

THE JAPANDI LOOK
It’s a union of East and West. The idea is based on the combined aesthetic of simplicity and imperfection. The Japanese side is in charge of odd shapes and patterns, while the Nordic draws inspiration from moderation. Together, they create a unique, balanced and calm look. The key is that the styling should be simple, pared back, using only a few carefully considered and thoughtfully selected pieces. Spaces should be de-cluttered and airy, allowing for a peaceful flow.
SCENTS OF THE SEASON
It’s important to fill your home with the right smell of the season, too. A fragrant bowl of potpourri — in a wintry scent such as cinnamon, pine — can do the trick and will fill your home with seasonal cheer. Display the arrangement prominently on a casual winter table centrepiece.

GO FOR CONTRAST
Nordic design loves light, natural hues, natural woods while Japanese style is known for richer tones. Most Japandi rooms start with a darker base, usually a saturated, neutral shade and is combined with dark wood and forest green planters. Big sofas, soft throws, clever storage and some personal touches – it’s the hygge life with places to snuggle.

BRING IN SOFTNESS
Create a super-cosy feel in a family room by styling it with layers of soft furnishings like oversized cushions and furry throws. Invest in a cosy rug that adds colour and pattern. Lighting is another easy way to make living spaces feel inviting and intimate.

ACCESSORISE SMARTLY
Surround your home with aesthetic statement pieces to ensure the design feels intentional and warm. A sense of cosiness also comes from being surrounded by plenty of personal feel-good objects in the living room, family pictures, fun vases, plants and books. Open shelving helps you express your family’s personality, whether you’re colour-blocking your books, creating clusters of objects or having a gallery wall full of your favourite pictures and photographs.

STAY TOASTY
Sheepskin and velvet is the epitome of cosy winter home decor. It instantly brings warmth to any room. Place a sheepskin rug or a chaise to provide a toasty spot to tuck chilly toes while reading or relaxing.

COLOUR ME HAPPY

The colours of Japandi are soft tones of light greys, pale pinks, baby blues and pastel greens. You can beat the blues

by infusing your spaces with pops of cheery colour. A bright coffee cup, vase or a boldly patterned pillow will do the trick, and will ensure your neutral spaces don’t look stark and cold. The best bit is that bright elements can also last into the spring and summer


DECLUTTERING IS MUST

The implementation of this style means to be aware that every single piece of furniture, accessory and detail, no matter how small it is, has to have its place and function. The key look is to remove the extras making decluttering almost mandatory.


Use ceramics to add curves: Balance out the stark Scandi lines of a coffee table or dining table by introducing handmade vases and vessels in earthy tones and glazes."

Provide first aid immediately, and do this in consultation with your vet. Rush to the nearest emergency animal healthcare provider in case of injury.
Q. Can pet parents give first aid?
A: Yes. First aid is an emergency procedure to save the life of your pet, so anybody who observes the injury or trauma first can provide aid. You may request for basic first aid training from your vet, which will be quite useful at times of emergency. It should comprise a restraining equipment as your pet may bite you owing to its pain. Call your vet and explain the nature of injury or illness and ask for advice regarding first aid. Rush to your vet as quickly as possible, but don’t panic.


Q. What should you if your pet ingests intoxication and poisoning?
A: This is the most commonly-encountered emergency condition in dogs. Many a time, pets may be left unattended, at homes or in farms, they may succumb to accidental consumption of harmful and toxic substances: rat poisons, toilet cleaners, fertilisers, batteries, harmful drugs. As a first measure, read the product label of the consumed poisonous substance, which provides the details of the antidote. Your presence of mind in letting your vet know about the ingested poison can save your pet’s life. If your pet vomits the substance, it is a good sign. S/he now needs supportive therapy. Your vet will do the needful. If the substance comes in contact with the eyes or skin of your dog, wash it with clean, plain water. Take your pet to the doctor immediately afterwards.
Q. What can you do if the pet suffers from convulsions and seizures?
A: It may happen after ingesting some poisonous substance. It’s important not to frighten your pet. S/he should be kept very calm. Hold a towel or blanket and wait for a minute. In case the seizure continues, wrap the pet with a towel or blanket; you can protect him/her with some cushions. Keep your pet away from sharp and harmful objects which may cause further injury.

Q. How can you help your pet in case of accidents or trauma?
A: Take your pet to the doctor immediately. If the pet is bleeding, try to stop the flow of blood. Burn injuries can cause serious tissue damage. Cool down the burned area by gently pouring cold water mixed with some potassium permanganate (if available). Also, use ice pack as a cold compress to cool down the injured area. In such a situation, always consult your vet and rush to the clinic, as soon as possible.


Q. What is the method of providing artificial breathing to your pet?
A: In certain conditions of illness, your pet may stop breathing or it may be very shallow and deep. In such situations, provide the type of external breathing known as ‘rescue breathing’. Perform this external breathing process by shutting the dog’s mouth with your hand and pumping air into the pet’s nostrils directly by your mouth until you see his chest expanded. Once the chest expands, continue ‘rescue breathing’ once in every 4-5 seconds.

Keeping in the mind the sensitive situation in the capital, along with several small-budget film and ad shoots, the Delhi schedule of Tiger Shroff-starrer 'Baaghi 3' and two other major productions have either been postponed or cancelled.

A source adds, ""This has happened with three films with A-listers in the last month."" Sources say that permission for film shoots at India Gate will now be given after Republic Day.

"Created: Jan 12, 2020, 01:00 IST",Kashika.Bindrani@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,"Big, bold and beautiful: ‘Tis the season for oversized bags","The fashion world witnesses handbags shrinking and expanding with every passing season. And while we all saw the sudden reign of tiny bags last year – those impractical biscuit-sized hand accessories did us no good – and unless you have an entire team of people just to carry your stuff around, you need a bag that accommodate your belongings. If fashion shows and Instagram are anything to go by, big, slouchy, can-hold-everything-you-own kind of bags are now in vogue. Brands are coming up with stylish and chic versions of gigantic totes and sack-like shoulder bags that are now available in all kinds of quirky shapes and colours. So go on, bag one while you can!

Keep it casual and comfortable

Oversized bags are all about practicality and comfort. To style them the right way, pair them with casual clothes and underplay the other accessories. Oversized bags are for relaxed, fun outings, so keep your outfit casual and comfortable. ""Avoid carrying oversized bags to formal events and opt for a slick, minimalistic approach for the rest of your look,"" explains Dhruv Adiya Dave, celebrity stylist, adding, ""Carry it with a T-shirt, jeans and simple heels. Let the bag grab all the attention."" ""For day events, opt for a boho look and carry a bag with heavy mirror work or embroidery,"" says Dhruv. ""Overised bags are in trend right now. I recommend pairing them up with your resort wear as they're ideal for vacations,"" adds Preetham Jukalker, designer and celebrity stylist.

Clutch it
Stylists advice against carrying oversized totes to formal events. Office interviews are okay, but when it comes to parties, bigger is definitely not better. However, if you're someone who likes to carry your entire makeup kit, few changes of clothes and your hangover antidotes to parties, there are plenty of oversized slings and clutches to choose from. Dubbed as 'The Pouch' by a luxury fashion brand, oversized clutches are meant to be held in the crook of your arm, and can go well with dresses, jumpsuits, pant-suits and evening gowns. ""Oversized clutches and evening bags go best with a pair of formal pant-suits or with classic LBDs,"" says Saloni.

Winter look
For winters, designers recommend styling these bags with oversized trench coats or blazers. ""For an ideal winter look, wear a pair of high-waisted jeans, tan boots and an oversized coat. The oversized bag will add a chic touch to this outfit,"" says Saloni Sayal, founder of a luxury bag manufacturing company. Go for nude or basic colours and match the bag with your boots or your beanie for a put-together look. Since the bag will be the biggest accessory you'll be carrying, the colour you choose will define your outfit. For a bold outfit, go for a bright red or a pink tote bag, but keep the rest of your outfit neutral. And for a completely toned down outfit, just mix-and-match nude shades like camel, tan, off-white or even some pastels. If your coat or blazer is a bright pop of colour, it is best to keep the bag's colour basic and understated.



Consider it an investment
Since oversized bags are multi-purpose and can be carried almost everywhere, you should look at it as an investment and buy one that suits your requirements the best. Go for a brand that you trust and make sure the material is sturdy and of good quality. ""No matter what your budget is, make sure your bag is versatile enough to be carried across seasons and trends. Opt for neutral colours like black, cream, nude or tan so that they can go with most outfits,"" suggests Dhruv. When a luxury fashion brand posted pictures of oversized bags on their Instagram, one follower commented, ""The fashion half of my brain is in love and the other half is like I'm gonna miss seven calls before I find my phone in there"". If you don’t want to spend the whole day trying to find your stuff in your sack, Preetham suggests investing in a bag that has multiple compartments and pockets so that you can keep your stuff organised. Lastly, the purpose of these gigantic bags is to be able to carry a lot of stuff around, which means your bag will end up being heavy. So, it's essential to buy one that has broad handles so that you don't end up with sore shoulders.


Look out for the hardware

A general tip to keep in mind while matching a bag with your outfit is to pay attention to the hardware. In a perfect choice of outfit, the hardware and the detailing on your bag should match the buckles of you shoe, your belt and the rest of the accessories like earrings and necklace. For example, don't carry a bag that has rose-gold handles with silver earrings, or a bag that has silver embroidery with golden belt buckles. The same metal can also have different shades, so, if you're going for all gold accessories, make sure you're not sporting dull gold with bright gold, for example. Keep the shades as similar as possible.




Cheat sheet

Let it dangle: Don’t fill your oversized bag up to the brim. If you're carrying the bag as a fashion statement more than you are for utility, make sure to keep it light and let it dangle by your side for an effortlessly stylish look.

Make it 'charm'ing: There are many luxury brands that are selling mini bags as charms. If you've jumped on the micro bags bandwagon, but don't find them practical enough to be carried on a regular basis, a great way to put them to use is to carry them as charms for your oversized bags."

,"Created: Jan 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",Entertainment,Prithviraj: What I love most about acting are the moments of no control,"Many could effectively argue that 2019 belonged to Prithviraj, with the sci-fi thriller 9, record-breaking Lucifer and the superhit Driving Licence. This year, however, he seems to have decided to take it slow – announcing a three-month break to prepare for Aadujeevitham for which he will be shooting from March till September. In between, he also Ayyappum Koshyum coming up. In conversation with the actor and director.
Driving Licence was about a superstar and his greatest fan. But how different would Lucifer have been if you weren’t a Mohanlal fan?

I don’t know, maybe it would have been a better film, maybe not. But I am a huge Mohanlal fan. There’s this popular cliché that we want the Mohanlal of yore. I am really not looking for Mohanlal sir to go back and do that. He has done that and been the best at that. Now, he has evolved and aged, and today at this stage of his stardom, as a genuine fan you would want him to do what you think would suit him at this point in his career and Stephen Nedumpally in Lucifer fit that bill.


There are multiple times during the film’s shoot where I have told him that he has forgotten his shoulder tilt. That kind of shot comes from being a genuine fan. I am sure that if and when I direct Mammukka, I will have tonnes of similar things to tell him too because I have followed his career for so long and grown up watching his films. In my mind, there is a Mammukka I want to see now as a fan and I will keep pulling him to that Mammukka when I direct him.

You seemed very relaxed not just after Lucifer’s success last year but also while shooting the movie.

When we did Koode, (director) Anjali Menon asked me to just get into a pool and float every day, if I can. I asked her why and she was spot on in her observation. ‘I think you are a control freak,’ she said. Floating is basically letting go to stay buoyant. With control freaks, what happens is that you become more comfortable when you are more in control. The most control you can exercise on a film set is when you are directing, which is why I was relaxed while doing Lucifer.

But does relinquishing control as an artiste make you happy?

That is what I love most about acting. You think you can control everything but every actor would tell you that there are distinct moments of absolute no control in performance. That is my high. For a control freak, those moments are like a narcotic. I am not saying it happens for every shot but there are certain moments between action and cut when I realise that those things were unplanned and happened without me knowing. Lalettan has also told me this, he calls these ‘happy accidents’.

But when you make a smaller movie, you would assume you have lesser variables to control. So, why not do that?

The variables of direction remain the same, regardless of the size of the film. What probably differs between the kinds of film is that when you make a film like Lucifer, one important factor you consider is what would be the reaction of the viewer, who is the third person apart from the director and the actor. When you shoot a film as commercial as Lucifer, you design that into the filmmaking. For instance, if there’s a punchline, you throw a silent reaction because you expect applause there. You want the moment to sink in. In the truest sense of the narrative, you don’t need that counter close-up or pause, but in a film like Lucifer you design that into your filmmaking. In terms of variables, regardless of the size of the film, it remains the same. My exercise of making a film would remain the same, regardless of me doing Empuraan or a Rs 50 lakh film shot on a GoPro.

What about directing some of the younger actors?

I would love to direct Fahadh, Dulquer and Nivin. But the thing is I am basically an actor and I can’t be directing films one after the other even if I want to. That’s not how I am programmed. I still see myself as an actor. Direction is something I will do once in three years. I know that I am not going to end up as a director who has done 50 films. But once in a while I will do what I want to do. I have a few thoughts in mind, but it will all depend on what I want to do after Empuraan.



The promo material of Ayyappanum Koshyum seem to suggest it’s an intense film.

I think there’s a general perception that Ayyappanum Koshyum is a verbose, massy film. It’s not. It is a very intense, realistic kind of cinema. There is action in it, but not a lot. It is an interesting film for me because it presents an opportunity to do a layered character. I play a very flawed man. In a lot of ways, Biju Menon’s character plays the ideal guy. I had a ball playing the role. Also, we had fun in the sets, with Ranjiettan, Sachy and Biju, except for the fact that I was on a crash diet. I think that environment helped in the making of the film too. Even Biju’s portrayal in the film will be different.


The crash diet and your three-month break is for Aadujeevitham. What about its character Najeeb appealed to you the most?

I am not a very pious person, but there is something about Najeeb’s staunch focus on faith that I kind of understand. I guess my focus is mostly cinema and work. Supriya would tell you that when I am at work, I am only tuned in to that and nobody can talk to me. I get that with Najeeb’s faith. Also, the very interesting angle about thing is that for three years if a human communicates and interacts more with animals than men, who do you become one amongst? It’s an interesting physical, physiological and spiritual journey for the character. I hope all that comes through in the film and my performance. It’s a big film and we are taking a zero-compromise approach for the film. I resume filming for Aadujeevitham from beginning of March till September in Jordan, Egypt and some portions in India. Every other film will start only after that."

Though she’s been to Europe before, this trip was special because she chose to see fewer cities, but spend longer durations in each of them. “I backpacked, but unlike earlier trips when I was keen on ticking off places, this visit was more about a detailed tour of some of my favourite places and soaking in their vibe,” explains the actor.

She tried skiiing, but also stumbled over numerous times. “Yes, it’s more painful than it looks. I had a hard time walking after that,” says Samyuktha.

She opted to forego public transport or using a car and, instead, chose to walk around Prague. “You discover so many little gems that way. We found so many local eating joints and grubberies, because we were on foot,” she observes.

"Created: Jan 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,I have always harboured dreams of being an actor: Manju Maandavya,"Manju Maandavya, who has played character roles on screen before and has donned multiple other hats, including that of a writer, director and lyricist in the Kannada film industry, debuts as a hero in Sri Bharatha Baahubali, which releases on January 17. The multitasker shares how his debut as a hero had been impending, in a chat with Bangalore Times. Excerpts:
After Yash-starrer Masterpiece, Sri Bharatha Baahubali is your second film as director and you feature as the protagonist. Was becoming a hero always on your mind?
During my college days, I had starred in a film called Prema as the lead. Since then, I have always harboured dreams of being an actor. However, when I started my career, I decided to dabble with multiple aspects of filmmaking to keep options open, and writing clicked. I wrote for over 30 movies and eventually it became my comfort zone. So, I was looking for a change. That’s how my acting stint in Raja Huli happened.

After that, people started asking me to act more and many wanted me to take up a rural subject. After directing Masterpiece, there was anticipation about what I would take up next. Many actors were busy and had commitments for a year or two and I did not want a completely new face to play the lead in my next. I believed a familiar face will help the movie attain commercial success. Around that time, I got the idea of Sri Bharatha Baahubali. Bharatha, the protagonist, is a village boy. He had to look natural and relatable and I thought it was a good role to debut with. I knew I wanted Chikkanna to play Baahubali as our performances in Raja Huli was liked by the audiences. Therefore, this seemed a promising film to begin with.

Many people had questioned your decision to turn a hero. Did that lead to apprehensions? People, including Chikkanna and music director Manikanth Kadri, asked me why I chose to turn a hero. I’ve been part of theatre productions before and have also done character roles in films. So, I was confident that I could play this role.

You have always juggled multiple roles, including that of a writer, actor, director and lyricist and Sri Bharatha Baahubali is no exception. How easy or difficult is it for you to multitask?
I am from a theatre background and have experience in writing, acting, singing and dancing for multiple stage productions. So, multitasking comes easily to me.


You also debut as a singer with this movie. How did that happen?

Mani and I have a great rapport. I'd write lyrics and then he would compose the tune. When writing Kannamuche, Mani asked me to sing the track so that he could record it later with the singers. However, after hearing me sing, he thought my voice worked well with Mythri Iyer, who sang the female’s part, and that I had done justice to the Mandya slang in the song. So, we decided to retain my voice for the track.


Tell us about your camaraderie with Chikkanna.

There are some roles that I am sure will click with the audiences. I get an intuition when I am writing them. Chikkanna’s role in Raja Huli was one such role. I had told him back then that offers would pour in after that film and they did. He is one of the most popular performers in the Kannada industry. He trusts my writing and I know his prowess as an actor and comedian. When I narrated Sri Bharatha Baahubali, he came on board immediately.


The movie has been in the making for a long time. Did the wait get stressful?

Cinema is my passion and is not a process that can be hurried. We have paid attention to every aspect of this movie. For example, there is a scene that is set in a sunflower field. We waited for three months to shoot the scene so that the flowers are in full bloom. Also, every person on board has been chosen after a lot of thought. Therefore, I have no regrets about the time this movie has taken. Thankfully, the producer too shared my passion, so it came out well."

Most of the children belong to the lower strata of society, and the lack of a school would have meant the end of the road for them, as far as academics is concerned. But there’s now a ray of hope, as the Railway workshop in Mysuru, which is in the vicinity of the school, has found a solution to this problem. On Saturday, four decommissioned railway coaches at the workshop were thrown open as a makeshift school for these kids. According to the school’s head mistress, HM Jayalakshmi, it was announced last year that the building would be demolished, and the new building would be up in a year. “Senior officials from the railway workshop came up with the idea of converting a few old coaches, which would have otherwise been sold for scrap metal, into classrooms,” she says.



Apart from fresh coats of paint, the bogies were also worked on to create the concept of Nali-Kali (learn while you play). From information about the solar system to alphabets, numbers and more, the railway department has gone all out to create an ideal environment for these children. When the ‘new school’ was thrown open for the kids, they excitedly scampered in to see their classrooms for the next year. “Our train school will begin functioning this week,” adds Jayalakshmi.

"Created: Jan 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,"Actors are actors with talent; there is no yesteryear, veteran","For Sarath Kumar, 2020 has been earmarked for a number of film roles, among which are his reunion project with actress and his wife Radikaa Sarathkumar, Vaanam Kottatum, and Mani Ratnam’s grand telling of Kalki’s saga Ponniyin Selvan. While the year does look promising, this is only just the beginning, the 65-year-old actor tells us with a warm smile, as we settled in for a chat at his office. Excerpts from the interview:

With Vaanam Kottatum, you will be reuniting with Radikaa on screen after 22 years. Tell us how that experience was...

She is such a refined actor. I would go on to add that Radikaa is one of the best actors this industry has seen. She plays all her roles with such conviction. Her growth in the industry is massive. In Vaanam Kottatum, Radikaa and I play a married couple. It is such a lovely script that it instantly drew me to it. I think our off-screen chemistry as a married couple definitely seeped into the characters as well. The camaraderie that we share definitely helped us flesh out our characters better.
Your other big upcoming release is Mani Ratnam’s magnum opus, Ponniyin Selvan. Do you have a favourite character from that universe?
Mani Ratnam is a master storyteller. And Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan is one of the most complex, yet detailed books I have come across. It is so detailed that each and every character in the book can have their own backstory.
I cannot pick a favourite because all the characters are so well written— be it Nandini or Ponniyin Selvan or Pazhuvettaraiyar. Such a book needs very accurate and perceptive writing, which the project has achieved so beautifully. The book is an exciting saga of genres: It has comedy, action, romance and drama.

What did your research for the project involve?
The entire look and feel of the film has been confirmed. Once the crew comes back from their Bangkok schedule, Mani Ratnam will confirm the looks and I will mostly begin shooting in the next 15-20 days.
I have read the book already. But I am now reading the 5-volume book once again. I am now in the middle of the third volume. I am going through the characterisation once again to refresh my mind. It has a huge scope to be filmed because the content is that vast. It will be a big film and will have an impact.

How have films and the way you look at films changed over the years?
When I did Suryavamsam, it was one of the most watched films at that time. The longevity of the film was such. Today, it’s quite tough to measure the longevity of a film. I think that is one of the ways in which films have changed over the years.

But do you think seasoned actors like yourself are getting all the opportunities they deserve today in the space of new-age cinema?
Today, you have films like Robert De Nero’s The Irishman and Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce’s The Two Popes, both with the most seasoned actors from the industry, doing so well among audiences. When it comes to actors, there is nothing called yesteryear, current or veteran. Actors, at the end of the day, are actors with talent. The audience is ready to accept us if different stories are presented to them. This is something that the industry should collectively think about because I cannot just keep making films and star in it, too. They should start thinking about actors like Amitabh Bachchan in Piku and Pink. You can also tailor-make a film for an actor based on their strengths. Films like these could be made in a lesser budget and can still be a commercial success.

Do you think things are looking up in this regard?
It should change and I hope things look up this New Year. I am not trying to blame anybody. People do look at us and know how we have maintained ourselves and how we perform. That way, I am very grateful to Mani Ratnam for giving me Vaanam Kottatum and his next film (Ponniyin Selvan).

We look at marketability instead of taking challenges in terms of good scripts. You see Clint Eastwood still making movies and people still want to watch him. People often think that commercial films will work based on saleable or popular heroes. If a film is entertaining and has something for the audience, it will definitely be a grosser.


What are your expectations from 2020 in terms of your film choices?

I have got all the ingredients to make it again and I will make it this year (smiles). Films need to be socially conscious, but also does not necessarily need to remind people of the past. It is time to live in the society as one, think about climate change and use the stars that are available here. Films like Kanchana took me to the new-age audiences. Stars like me, Vijayakanth and Sathyaraj are still there. Audiences’ appetite to see us on screen is still not satiated. People still need to start writing stories for us.


Do you have any dream project?

A film on the court case of MR Radha is in the offing. It will be about two friends and will explore the story behind the shootout. Since biopics are in, I think this will make for a good story. We should also look at reinventing the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Even Kovalan and Kannagi’s story can be retold. If our values from the past are given a modern spin in films today, it will create a huge impact among audiences."

But did you know that Jiiva first met Srikkanth when he was a Class 8 student? “It was for a school project, and we were asked to interview one person who inspired us. I interviewed Chika (Srikkanth). It was in the year 1996, I think,” recollects Jiiva with a smile.
83 traces the journey of Kapil Dev (played by Ranveer Singh) and also chronicles India’s historic win at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Jiiva’s look as Srikkanth was released yesterday, and the first-look poster has been receiving rave reviews.

“We didn’t do any prosthetics,” states Jiiva, “We only worked on the hairstyle and I grew a moustache. I was also shooting for my other Tamil films. So literally, Seeru film mudichuttu anga shoot panna odinen. Most of the actors had started training for their roles, but I couldn’t participate in the camp throughout.”

So, how easy or difficult was it to become Srikkanth on screen for the film, which will also release in Tamil? “I’m a street player. If you’ve noticed boys who play gully cricket, you would have figured out how they always say there are going to bowl like Javagal Srinath or Waqar Younis or Wasim Akram. Many of my friends are batsmen and they used to say that they’d bat like Brian Lara or hold a stance like Sachin Tendulkar. In fact, most tennis ball cricketers play like Srikkanth; orey damaal dumeel dhan. So, I feel street cricketers can adapt to any style of batting or bowling,” explains the actor.


Jiiva adds, “Yes, my bat lift was very different from Chika’s, and to help me understand how he would hold and bat, Balwinder Singh Sandhu sir came down from Mumbai. Since I couldn’t attend the training camp in Mumbai for the first three months, I used to practice in Chennai. My friend Vineet Padmanabhan is also a cricketer, and he used to help me with the game here. Balwinder sir used to send us videos and we’d also send him videos of what we did here. He’d tell me what corrections I had to make, and Kabir Khan (director) would also tell me if what I was doing was fine. It’s not like I transformed into Chika in just one day. I breathed this character and lived the role, and playing him perfectly was a big deal for me. But I was confident I could pull it off because I’ve had the opportunity to interact with him and I’ve followed his game.”


The actor admits his confidence increased when Sunil Gavaskar came to the set once. “We were doing a take one day, just to see how everybody was in the frame. Gavaskar was silently observing the shot. He then called out on the mic and told me that I looked exactly like Chika,” he says, “Gundappa Viswanath sir, Gordon Greenidge and Clive Lloyd also said I resembled Chika.”"

Later, it was reported that she had walked out of the project to pick other films that had come her way.

I did that, but then she also received offers for Housefull 4 and Panipat. She would have had to waste six months to be a part of my film, as I was figuring out the dates with other actors. Kriti really wanted to do Malang, but she had to let go of it and choose other films instead. It is as simple as that, and nothing as sensational as the news reports claimed that, ‘she has walked out of the project’,” said Mohit."

Several flights have either been delayed, cancelled or diverted. Among the travelers who got caught in the situation was Atharvaa, who was en route Azerbaijan to shoot for his film with director Kannan. The actor spent over 24 hours at the Dubai airport, waiting for the runway to clear up.

A source in the know says, “Atharvaa had left Chennai on Saturday and he had a connecting flight to Azerbaijan at Dubai. However, the runway at the Dubai airport was completely submerged in water because of the deluge. The actor had no other option but to wait for over 24 hours before he could catch his next flight.”


Kannan, who reached Baku (capital of Azerbaijan) five days ago, confirms, “Atharvaa was supposed to join us on Sunday, but because of the flood situation in Dubai, he was stuck at the airport, with no other means of travel. He took a flight on Monday and reached Baku by noon. He’s joined Amitash Pradhan, Anupama Parameswaran and Aadukalam Naren and we started shooting the same day. This current schedule will go on till January 28 and post that, it’s a wrap for the film.”"

Talking to BT about it, he says, “I decided to opt out and it was an amicable decision. I felt that I was not able to justify my role as Dr Shashank Gupta in the current season, as compared to the previous ones. I did not want to let down my viewers, so it was best to move on.” Mohnish was a part of the first season of 'Sanjivani' (2002-2005), and he also featured in the spin off, 'Dill Mill Gayye' (2007-2010).

He says, “When this show started in August 2019, my track was going well, but things changed later. I discussed it with the makers and we tried exploring new angles, but they didn’t materialise. An actor can creatively enhance his character if there is clarity in the track or he is given the script much in advance, which unfortunately was not the case.”


Meanwhile, the show has moved to a different time slot. There’s also buzz that it will take a three-year leap with new actors."

A popular actor in Tulu films, Pruthvee says the opportunity to work on this show came at the right time in his career. “Although I’ve done films in Kannada before, I’m looking at the release of my first mainstream film sometime in March. It’s a big moment for me, so I was looking to familiarise myself with the Kannada audience. That’s when the makers of Jothe Jotheyali approached me,” he says. “It’s one of the top-rated serials in Kannada, so what better way than to be seen on it and let the audience know you are here?” he asks. The actor plays a legal advisor to Aryavardhan (Anirudh Jatkar) in the serial and shares that it’s a happy-go-lucky character. “It’s only for two months.

"Created: Jan 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Lifestyle,Bengalureans head out on an ant trail,"On a crisp weekend morning at Lalbagh recently, eager parents and children had gathered together for an ‘ant walk’. Guided by Sunil Kumar M – a senior science adviser at a foreign embassy, who has spent nearly 25 years observing ants – the event saw participants, armed with magnifying glasses, taking a stroll in the park to get a closer view of the lifestyle of this ‘eusocial’ insect.
Different types of ants and the activities they carry out
As the participants start observing the acrobat ants, Sunil explains that in an ant colony, specific roles are allocated to each ant. The queen ant is at the apex of the social hierarchy

Queen ant: Throughout her life, the queen primarily has only one purpose – to lay eggs and expand the colony. In most cases, the queen ant picks her successor. The untimely death of a queen may also signify the death of the colony. To ensure her protection, she is always hidden deep inside the ant colony.
Infertile male and female ants: These ants usually act as workers, foragers, nurses and care-givers for offspring. Their duties include finding food and cleaning the nest. Fertile male and female ants: The fertile male ants are thrown out of the colony, after which they need to find a virgin queen ant to mate with. Similarly, the fertile female ants are also thrown out. They can start their own colony once they find a suitable mate. Sometimes, these ants also challenge the authority of an existing female ant, in order to become the next queen.

Fun fact: Ever noticed an ant with wings? These are often the fertile male or female ants that are given wings, so that they can find a new mate and start a new colony.

Ants reprimand bad behaviour
If a worker ant tries to go rogue, fellow worker ants are known to bite that ant and bring it back into line. This happens because ants believe in working towards the greater good for the colony.

Conquests and colony expansion
Ants’ most common enemies are termites – they often fight for survival in similar habitats. Ants are also known to wage war on other ant colonies, in order to capture more worker ants for their own colony. The conquerors, thus, add more workers to their own colonies, branding them with their trademark smell.

Farming and water harvesting
Some ants take up farming and grow fungus. They also milk a few insects and drink their nectar. Some others again use feathers for their nests in a way that they catch the morning dew and store it for later use.

The travel patterns that ants follow
After spotting a solitary ant, a participant of the walking group asked, “Don’t ants walk in lines?” Responding to that, Sunil said that the trail network is not a general characteristic. According to him, some ant colonies are large in number, so foragers set out together and bring food home. They leave the trails on their path with pheromones, as if to announce: “Look, I found food here.” However, some colonies have fewer ants and, in such a situation, solitary ants set out to find food.
He also shared a research that he and his team had undertaken, in which they marked large forager ants that stepped out to get food in specific colours and studied their routines. “Ants are very disciplined, and they stick to the paths assigned to them. Among the ones we had marked, we saw that each ant stuck to a particular route. One day, however, we removed one of these colour-marked ants. And we were stunned to find that the very next day, a non-marked ant stepped out looking for food in the same path of the ant that we had removed, indicating there was some knowledge transfer taking place in the nest,” he explains.

Do ants bite or sting?
On their way, the participants spot a red weaver ant on a tree. “Careful. They sting when alarmed,” warned Sunil, adding, “Often when ants bite or sting, they risk injuring themselves. There are some ants that have evolved in a way that they can bite into your skin first, to cause a cut, and then spray chemical water inside the wound.”


Some of the common ants found in Bengaluru

Fire ant (solenopsis geminate): Infamous for their biting habit, these ants can easily adapt to any surroundings.

Black crazy ant (paratrechina longicornis): A black crazy ant is known for her habit of cleaning her own legs

Odour ants (tapinoma melanocephalum): These house ants apparently lap up sugar.

Acrobat ant (crematogaster: An acrobat ant lifts her gaster to release alarm pheromones

Weaver ant (oecophylla smaragdina): These ants are said to coax their offspring to release silk that they use to stick leaves as they build their nest.


Did you know?
Some ants are blind. These insects can function perfectly well without eyes. They can go about their daily tasks using only their sense of touch and smell."
"Created: Jan 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Dhoondte reh jaoge! TV actors struggle to find a home in Mumbai,"Mumbai is known to attract tons of young aspirants from across the country, especially those who want to try their luck in showbiz. For most of them, getting a house on rent, is not easy. The bachelor tag comes at a price, so does being from the film and TV industry. In addition, societies are not open to actors who are in a live-in relationship. BT spoke to artistes from the TV frat who have had to struggle to find a good house, in a locality of their choice.
‘Most flat owners are reluctant as they feel actors do not live disciplined lives’
— Abhishek Kapur

Currently seen in 'Kundali Bhagya', actor Abhishek Kapur came to Mumbai from Delhi, five years ago. Initially, he stayed with his cousins, but later decided to rent a place. Sharing his experience, the Versova resident says, “I have been looking for a new, plush apartment in Mumbai for a couple of months now. But as an actor, it’s getting tough to get a good flat in a decent society. I have come to realise in the past couple of months that even if the landlord is fine with renting out his/her flat to actors, the society isn’t. Deals break down sooner or later. They point out to our lifestyle that they believe is undisciplined, but don’t non-actors also party and work late hours? Even the price they quote to an actor is quite different from what they charge a regular office-goer.”
‘For 10 years, I struggled to find a house because I am an actor who is single’

— Anjum Fakih

Currently residing in Versova, Anjum, who hails from Ratnagiri, has been living in Mumbai since her childhood. However, her parents did not support the idea of her becoming a model/actor and she decided to leave her home. Since then, for the last 10 years, the actress admits that she has been living out of suitcases. She says, “My profession was the biggest issue for most landlords. Being single and having no support from parents was another challenge I faced in finding a house. I had left my house way back in 2010-11. People felt that it would not be right to rent out a place to an actor, who is also single. I expect people to be liberal in their thoughts, but we fail to accept change or growth.”

‘It has taken us almost 80 houses to find a housing society that allows pets and Couples in a live-in relationship’

— Sanjay Gagnani

Sanjay Gagnani, who has been part of shows like 'Hamari Devrani', 'Encounter', 'Veera' and 'Pyaar Ka The End', feels that Indian society is never open to bachelors, live-in relationships and pets. Sanjay relocated to Mumbai in 2010 and stayed in Bandra for two years. He then moved to Andheri (in 2011-15 ) and Goregaon (in 2016-2019). Currently, he’s back to living in an apartment in Lokhandwala (Andheri). He says, “Most housing societies refrain from allowing bachelors
in their premises. It took me a while to find a society that allowed a bachelor. When I got engaged to Poonam and started living-in, I had to hide her when the landlady visited the house as she was against unmarried couple living-in. Finally, we had to move out. While moving in to another accommodation, the broker wanted us to lie about our marital status. We somehow managed to live there peacefully for three years because they thought we were married. Problems cropped up when we got two pets. The housing society opposed us and we had to leave. It took us a good four months and almost 80 houses to find a housing society that matched our criteria, and allows pets and a couple in a live-in relationship.

‘There can’t be separate rules for actors. What if a corporate professional creates issues?’
— Priyanka Choudhary
'Gathbandhan' actress Priyanka Choudhary relocated from Jaipur to Mumbai in 2014, and has been living in Lokhandwala (Andheri). The actress feels there are no regulations or rules when it comes to renting out flats in Mumbai. She says, “If you are single, it apparently means you are loud and will get friends over to chill. If that is not enough, the distrust towards our profession is apparent; they do not trust us to maintain decorum. Shouldn’t the concern be about us not paying rent on time? What if a corporate professional creates issues? Standardising the process of renting out flats is the best way possible. One common rule for everyone should be
maintained, regardless of their marital status or
profession.”

‘When Pariva and I wanted to live-in, Flat owners simply refused to give us their place’
— Puneet Sachdev
Puneet Sachdev relocated to Mumbai from Gwalior in 2005. In the initial days, he faced a problem finding a house because he was a bachelor-actor. Later, when he wanted to live-in with his actress girlfriend Pariva Pranati, who is his wife now, people refused to rent him an apartment. He says, “When you say you are an actor and single, society members look at you with suspicious eyes. Things have improved in the last four-five years, though. When Pariva and I used to meet members of various housing societies, they would be shocked that we were living-in and were looking for a house. Their first reaction would be ‘no’. I found it silly. After all, what is the guarantee that a married couple or a family renting a house will not create nuisance for you?'

‘My mother had to relocate from Jammu to facilitate the process of finding an apartment”
— Vineet Raina
Vineet Raina came from Jammu in 2005 and it’s not been easy for him since then. He shares, “It seems to be a big crime to be an actor, who is single. Over the past few years, I have had a tough time searching a flat, from the suburbs of Andheri to Kandivali. Finally, I had to call my mom to Mumbai in 2010 to rent a flat in a decent locality. My mom came down from Jammu and stayed with me for a few months. My dad had just been through a surgery at that time and would have done better with my mom being around, but unfortunately, she had to stay with me in Mumbai to help me find an accommodation without any hitch.”

‘Landlords refuse to rent me an apartment on the basis of examples of actors who’ve got embroiled in controversies in the past’
— Rehaan Roy

Rehaan Roy, who is currently seen in 'Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega', relocated from Kolkata to Mumbai in 2016 and started living in Borivali with a friend. In 2017, he rented a place in Andheri, but faced unnecessary issues because people keep looking at him with suspicion. He says, “The landlord felt that my being an actor would create nuisance because it would mean girls visiting late nights. For six months, I did not get a house and continued staying at my cousin’s place. Whenever I tried to rent a flat, they’d give examples of crimes like the Maria Susairaj case (the starlet was accused of murdering TV executive Neeraj Grover in 2008) and Pratyusha Banerjee’s suicide in 2016. They have said no to hosting friends overnight, and having a girlfriend is also considered a crime.”


What landlords have to say...

Landlords say housing societies do not want flats to be given to actors as there have been a few bad examples in the past. Grisly murders involving struggling actors and suicide cases have also made owners wary of people from showbiz.

Lashkarm Parakh, head of a housing society in Goregaon, says, “Actors may complain that housing associations and societies have set such rules, but people have witnessed nuisance in the past. A few months ago, I had rented my apartment to a single actor/manager and she used to host parties at odd hours with loud music. She also had actors coming over and bribing the security guards for better car parking space. They would quarrel with other flat owners when asked to follow the rules.”

Another flat owner, Raman Gupta, said, “I had rented my flat to a celeb couple, who claimed to be married. After a few weeks, I came to know that the couple was not married and had no intention of getting married, either. So, one has to be careful.”"
"Created: Jan 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Prathibha Joy,Entertainment,A sleeping beauty and a terrible scam in Jadesh Kumar's next,"As he counts down to the release of his second directorial, Gentleman, Jadesh Kumar has mixed emotions. After the lukewarm response to his debut, Rajahamsa, which pushed him to write a “better film”, he is very happy with what he has been able to bring to the table, but is also nervous and excited to see how audiences react to the Prajwal Devaraj starrer. “I hail from a very small village near Hampi, and back when I was in high school and, subsequently, college, I was in a hostel,” says Jadesh.


Jadesh adds, “Most of the students were hardcore fans of different actors and films in other languages as well, and it is there that my craze for Kannada movies began. Not only would we watch all films that released, but we also had typical fan brawls. The issue, though, was that this was also a time when a lot of the Kannada films that released were remakes, which gave me no leg to stand on during these fights with friends. More than the films, I was crazy about Kannada language, and I often wondered what I could do about this.” He then came to Bengaluru as soon as he finished his graduation, on the pretext of finding a job. What he did, then, was to enroll himself for a filmmaking course at the Directors’ Association, while also working as an office boy there. “I didn’t need that job, but I realised that it gave me access to a whole bunch of filmmakers and not only those who taught us as part of the course. During the months that I was doing the course, and working there, I got to have many meaningful conversations with directors, which were very insightful. When I finished my course, I wrote the script for a film called Dildar. Director Guru Deshpande saw the film and recommended it to many others and got me to join his team,” says Jadesh, who went on to assist the former on films like Raja Huli and Rudratandava, among others.

His directorial debut, Rajahamsa, didn’t work at the box office. “It got me thinking what went wrong, and I realised that it did not give audiences anything novel. It paved the way for me to work harder and write a story that had something extra. As someone who follows news keenly, I came across something about the sleeping beauty syndrome, wherein the person suffering from it sleeps for hours together. When normal people work for 18 hours a day and sleep for six, I wondered how it would be for someone with the syndrome and switched those figures,” explains Jadesh.

But he knew that a story around a medical condition would not be enough to draw audiences, so, Jadesh found a way to link it to the issue of illegal harvesting of egg cells from young women. “How the hero, Prajwal, takes on this mafia, while also dealing with his medical condition forms the crux of the story. But even though the film is a thriller, the entire narrative is not grim and much of Prajwal’s attempt at dealing with his condition involves situational comedy,” says the director. His biggest challenge, adds Jadesh, was to present all this within a manageable budget, which meant shooting at actual locations and not sets. “Several sequences in the film have been shot at garbage dumps and drainage tunnels, among others. In fact, when we shot at a garbage dump in Mysuru, to get to the location, we brought in an earth mover and created a stretch of road. When we moved the waste that has been decaying there for long, the stench was unbearable, but Prajwal never complained. We had many extensive schedules during the making of this film, to maximise output in the limited time we had permission to shoot, and Prajwal stood by me through it all,” Jadesh signs off."

For many working professionals, a new year means a couple of months to go for the dreaded appraisal. While the pressure to achieve targets in office usually peaks as the year starts, experts say that one should not let it bog them down as it doesn't only affect their mental well-being, but may also lead to a loss of productivity. Several studies have explored the connection between a person's workplace and mental health, and a high number conclude that a toxic workplace has a negative health impact on people.

""I was constantly under pressure to achieve my sales targets due to which my stress levels shot up and I could not sleep for more than four-five hours at night. I assumed this is normal in this industry, so never paid any heed to it,"" says Yatin, a 30-year-old executive at a sales firm, who only realised that he has an anxiety disorder when he was hospitalised due to a panic attack last year. And Yatin is hardly a one-off case as many people suffer from similar issues.

A healthy workplace
According to WHO, a healthy workplace can be described as one where workers and managers actively contribute to the working environment by promoting and protecting the health, safety and well-being of all employees.

Cut the stigma: Availing sick leave for mental health
In June 2017, an employee at Olark, a software company, shared her email exchange with her boss on Twitter. The employee had emailed her team about her absence from work, citing mental health as her reason to take a two-day leave. To this, the company’s CEO responded, ""I just wanted to personally thank you for sending emails like this. Every time you do, I use it as a reminder of the importance of using sick days for mental health. I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations. You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can bring our whole selves to work.""


Making mental health a priority at the workplace
In November 2018, after celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade committed suicide, Chuck Robbins, the CEO of Cisco, an American multi-national company, made headlines when he sent a company-wide email to Cisco's almost 75,000 employees. The subject line read: ""Making Mental Health a Priority"". In the email, Robbins encouraged employees to ""talk openly and extend compassion"" and told them that professional help was available for them. More than 100 employees responded to him, with many detailing their own struggles.

Early signs
Psychotherapist Urvashi Bisht, currently practicing at Maulana Azad Medical College,who has conducted sessions on mental health at corporate offices, states some early signs of mental distress.
1. One of the warning signs can be when a person is confused about their emotions and is unable to understand what they are feeling – it's emotional confusion
2. When a person feels stressed due to work, they cannot work efficiently and are unable to balance personal, social and work life
3. Lack of sleep and appetite


'Seek a family member, friend or a colleague to confide in'
Dr Sandeep Govil, psychologist at Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, says, ""Lately, the stigma around mental health issues has decreased and as a result people are more open to seeking help. At least four out of my 10 patients suffer from psycho-disorders related to office politics or high targets.""

Dr Govil says that rather than bottling up feelings, confiding in colleagues or family members should be the first step towards reducing stress. He says, ""My advice to anyone having a hard time at work is to seek a friend, colleague or a family member to confide in. One should also take small breaks at work to avoid getting bogged down by stress.""


'Separate your self-worth from job profile'

Psychotherapist Urvashi Bisht adds, ""Recently, I have seen an increase in cases where a person feels that they are over-qualified for their job, or there is a confusion regarding their role at the workplace. This leads to them assessing their self-worth on the basis of the work they do, which often leads to depression. I advise them to separate their self-worth from their job profile and promote self-love.""




Nap rooms, green zones to improve work environment
A Noida-based electronics firm has nap rooms in their office to help employees take short breaks for napping during work hours. ""Due to the nature of our work, we often spend over 15 hours working in office for a project. As employers we recognise that this can put strain on not just the physical, but also the mental health of our employees as well,"" says Mohit Mongia from NXP Semiconductors in Sector 16A, Noida.


Sushant Patnaik, Head HR, Aeris Communications in Sector 62, Noida, says that their organisation keeps in mind the needs of their employees and constantly strives to make a better environment for them at work. ""The leadership and managers at our organisation are oriented to be aware and respectful of employees' needs for personal breaks and their right to a stress-free work environment. Everyone is encouraged to come forth and share suggestions on how to continuously improve the workplace to keep it stress free.

"Created: Jan 14, 2020, 01:00 IST",Akash Wadhwa,TV,I have entertained a lot inside the Bigg Boss house but that wasn’t aired: Khesari Lal Yadav,"Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav has shot several movies in Lucknow. “15 to be exact!” shares Khesari as we met up with him while he was shooting for his 16th film at Kudiya Ghat in old Lucknow. “Out of the total of 20 movies shot in the state, 15 have been in Lucknow. Locations are not only good but are also easily available in Lucknow and this ease of shooting compels us to come here and shoot one movie after another. But a change that I have noticed in Lucknow is that shooting here has become a costlier affair, especially because of the hotels. Their tariffs have gone high and most of them are also booked for a good number of days since so many films are being shot here.Locations too have become quite expensive now. Rates bahut badh gaye hain,” he says. But the main attraction for the filmmakers, as per Khesari is, the ‘subsidy’. “The government subsidy is the major attraction for filmmakers as it is definitely a big help to us. Most of my films shot in UP have got subsidy and only a handful are in process. I don’t know about the amount as it is a producers prerogative but if the paper work is fine and up to date, subsidy is not an issue,” he says.

Ask him about his short and sweet stay in the Bigg Boss house and he shares, “My stay was good but it is just that I couldn’t fight. Hamare UP ya fir Bihar se koi bhi jayega toh usko problem hogi adjust karne mein as we do not fight over petty issues. Plus, I, at any cost, was not ready to use cuss words for publicity inside the Bigg Boss house. The Bigg Boss fame, if you see in the past at the list of previous contestants and the winners, is very short lived. For that short lived fame I was not ready to stoop to such a level of abusing others. In real life also, I haven’t fought with people; so I realised soon that Bigg Boss was not meant for me. I was a misfit for a show like Bigg Boss. It is not that I don’t know cuss words, but I am an icon for many, and I wanted to remain that even after appearing on that show. It took me a lot of time to become Khesari Lal Yadav and I respect that and that was what was playing on in my mind while I used to see celebrities abusing each other.”

Another reason why Khesari think he couldn’t get votes of people during his stay in the Bigg Boss house was because his singing was not aired. “I used to sing a lot inside the Bigg Boss house but then it was announced by Bigg Boss that I couldn’t sing the songs of my choice as then they will have to procure rights of those songs to be aired. I am majorly a singer. I can’t act there so I used to sing. I have entertained a lot inside the Bigg Boss house but that wasn’t aired as it was mostly my singing stints,” he rues."

The filmmaker had quit direction two decades ago, but returned to the studio floor on Sanjay’s insistence. The actor and the filmmaker share an equation that dates back to the time when they first worked together on 'Naam' (1986). Sanjay says, “We’re nearly done with Sadak 2’s shoot. Bhatt saab is such an enthusiastic director and that hasn’t changed. He’s so focussed on his job as a director even though he’s doing it after 20 years. He’s done everything to keep up with today’s times. The kind of hours he has spent on the sets and the effort he has made to lead a young crew on this film is amazing and inspiring. Today, when I look back, it feels justified that we all decided that 'Sadak' (1991), as a story, should move ahead. It should not stop where it did decades ago. I remember I first spoke to Pooja (Bhatt) about this and then, we met and took this forward. When Bhatt saab came on board to write the story, I told him, ‘Either you direct it or I’m not doing the film.’ He gave in, and I’m glad that he did.”"

The actress will be playing a dancer in debutant Jai Vijay Kumar’s Irali, which stars Vennish Kanna in the lead.

“I can say for sure that no one else has used bananas to narrate a story that is of utmost importance to our society,” begins the director confidently, “In 2010, when I was assisting SP Rajkumar sir, I had gone to Koyambedu to buy a banana thaar. I’d seen people immersing bunch of fruits in a drum full of chemicals. When I enquired, I was told that while it may take a week for bananas to ripen naturally, spraying them with chemicals, like certain kinds of acid powders fastens the process. I also learnt that if the amount of chemicals exceeds the permissible quantity, the fruits could turn poisonous and it may lead to cancer. It got me thinking, and I decided to make a film based on that.”

The team got Cheran to launch the title of the film. “Irali is a word we picked up from Tirukkural, and it means Theengu (harm). The film is set in Pollachi, and the team has almost completed the movie. “It’s a simple story that narrates the ill effects of industrial chemical waste,” says Vijay Kumar, who has previously directed a few short films, “When I had met a distributor in Tiruppur, he told me the story is very relatable because recently, several tonnes of artificially ripened bananas were seized by officials.”


Vennish insists that the film will be an entertaining fare and not be preachy. “Yes, we have a message — tampering with nature will have disastrous effects. The film traces the lives of four farmers and their sons, who lease out an agricultural land that has lost its fertility because of illegal dumping of untreated industrial chemical waste. How they then start working for a man who deals in bananas and educate others in their village about the harms of disturbing nature’s balance has been narrated in an entertaining manner,” he signs off."

That has changed now, as Harsha released the first visuals from the film on the auspicious festive occasion. “We didn’t want to reveal details and visuals from the film earlier on, as it would take away the novelty factor,” Harsha maintained. While sources had hinted that Shivarajkumar would have a unique look in the film, the poster teases audiences with a sneak peek of that. It also features another character bearing a torch in hand, and appears to be in search of something, which adds to the curiosity. “This character will be releaved in February. If you can see, the character looks like a brahmin in search of something. There is an element of spirituality in the film, which is what has been revealed here,” says Harsha. He also reveals that the film is set over multiple timelines. “We have a period element to it, as well as segments that are set in present day. And Shivarajkumar’s look is something that we are eager to reveal, but fans will have to wait till March when we show it fully,” says Harsha.

Bhajarangi 2 will see Shivarajkumar paired with his Tagaru leading lady Bhavana again. Harsha and Shivarajkumar have earlier delivered two successful films with Bhajarangi and Vajrakaya, which has raised the expectations of the film."

Many youngsters flocked to ‘Lasya 2020’, Jain (deemed-to-be) University’s inter-college cultural fest, while National Law School of India University (NLSIU’s) music fest, ‘Strawberry Fields’, also witnessed a huge turnout.
Students from various colleges battled it out with their counterparts to bag coveted awards in various activities such as making group ads, fashion shows, battle of the bands and dance performances. Dancer-choreographer-actor Priyank Sharma was the judge for the inter-college dance competition on Day 2 of ‘Lasya’. This fest also hosted comic Aakash Gupta and Delhi-based band Antariksh on the same day. The battle ended with Manga from St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous) — claiming the first place.

‘Strawberry Fields’, on the other hand, witnessed performances by a host of music bands and artistes like OnebyTwo, The Figs, Skrat, Parvaaz and Joshua Fernandez aka JBabe from the F16s fame. The headliners belted out original tracks — covering genres like rock and roll, indie pop and alt rock. Under the ‘Battle of the Bands’ category, artistes were seen performing their sets as well as competing with their contemporaries. The battle ended with Iyer’s Filter Coffee and Spotlight — claiming the first place.
I was a very shy student: stand-up comic Aakash Gupta
Reminiscing about his college days, Aakash said, “I was a very shy student until I joined the theatre society in my college. And that’s how I explored the artiste in me. Before that, I used to focus only on my studies and nothing else. During my days at Delhi University, we barely used to have such big events. So, now when I perform for a college crowd, it feels good and I love the energy they exude.”

A walk down memory lane for Antariksh
Sharing their story, the bandmates of Antariksh said, “Our journey as a music collective began during our university days in Delhi, when we used to jam together.”

Varun Rajput, frontman of the band, added, “In 2012, we decided to leave our corporate jobs and become full-time musicians. And that’s how the band came about. Performing for college audience reminds us of our own time as students.”


Priyank Sharma’s impromptu act won students’ heart

At the fest, dancer-choreographer Priyank was spotted inquiring about each dance team’s efforts and the narrative behind their act. “As a dancer, it is wonderful to see performances that has a story to tell, apart from good dance patterns and choreography,” he said. He also won the hearts of the students when he closed the competition with an impromptu performance, where he didn’t stick to one dance style, but instead incorporated freestyle, hip-hop and other genres.


Skrat goes full circle at Strawberry Fields

Chennai-based band, Skrat, performed their original compositions on the last day of ‘Strawberry Fields’. Expressing how much they admire Bengaluru and the college fests it hosts, frontman Sriram said, “Bengaluru is a place where one finds many music lovers, who are enthusiastic about starting their own bands as well as collaborate with other artistes, while also inculcating their unique takes on various musical genres and instruments. When we were starting out, I remember how we would compete in ‘Battle of the Bands’, and it was so difficult to secure the top positions. We still can’t believe that we are headlining the same fest.”"

"Created: Jan 15, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,I remember making sakkare achchu when I was young: Rishi,"January is time for celebrations in Indian households, especially for newly-weds.

The couple will be celebrating their first Sankranti and Pongal together. “We are looking forward to this festival. We will be celebrating it with Swathi's parents in Hyderabad, since it is our first big festive occasion after our wedding. We are looking forward to the time with family as well as all the treats that will be made,” says the actor.

The duo have fond memories of the harvest festival from their childhood. For Swathi, who is Tamilian, it was all about bonding with the family and community. “I grew up in Japan, so we had a close-knit Tamilian community there that used to celebrate the festival in all its glory, as it is bigger than Deepavali for us,” she says.

As for Rishi, he recalls, “I remember making sakkare achchu when I was younger. Today, we get all the things that we gift other households readily in the markets. But during my childhood, we used to partake in the festivities and make the hampers that were to be gifted to relatives and neighbours. In fact, I never realised that giving ellu-bella to households was up to the ladies of the household. I used to get bullied by my sister Nethra into joining her.”

Rishi and Swathi, who are still finding their way around the kitchen, admit that they aren’t the biggest of cooks. But both of them agree that they love eating all the goodies made by their families during festivals."
"Created: Jan 15, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Deepak in a medical thriller,"For a passionate artiste, language is no barrier. And that’s what drives Sandalwood actor Deepak Shetty to expand his repertoire beyond languages and regional boundaries. Deepak, who has done several Kannada and Telugu films, including Panchatantra, Aadi Lakshmi Purana and iSmart Shankar, is now debuting in Kollywood with Battery. Directed by Manibharathi, the film is a medical thriller and stars Senguttuvan and Ammu Abhirami (of Asuran fame) in the lead.

“For me, doing different films in different languages is a learning experience. I get to be a different person every other day, and I get to learn a lot,” begins Deepak, “In Battery, I play a police commissioner. It’s a neutral character — he is an honest cop, and is very attached towards his family. It’s very difficult to draw a line between right and wrong for him. This character and the lead hero’s character travel together in the film.”


So, did he have any difficulty in picking up Tamil? “Your confidence level is a lot better when you know the language. You can change the syntax of a sentence and narrate it in your style. But the team of Battery was very cooperative. They’d prompt me and also help me with the meaning of my lines. Otherwise, there will be non-sync between your expressions and the lines you deliver,” says Deepak, who is also busy with the Telugu remake of Vetri Maaran-Dhanush film Asuran, which stars Venkatesh in the lead."
"Created: Jan 15, 2020, 00:00 IST",Arya UR,Entertainment,Navya Nair: Oruthee has thrilling segments that will engage all audiences,"She lent an unforgettable charm to Balamani, the innocent, ardent devotee of Guruvayoorappan, and won a place in the hearts of Malayalis in Nandanam. Now, after an eight-year gap from her last film. Kannada-venture Dhrishya, she is all set to make a comeback through Oruthee, a V K Prakash directorial. In the midst of her shuttling between her busy dance schedules and family life, we catch up with her to know more about her comeback, family and her hopes for her second innings.


What prompted you to make a comeback to films after eight years through VKP’s film?
I was not completely detached from films or acting. When I heard the script of the film, Oruthee, from (scriptwriter) S Suresh Babu sir last year, I found it very engaging and thrilling. I chose it, because it is not a slow-paced movie. I love commercial movies that engage the audience. Apart from the thriller element, the film is centred around my character, a common woman employed as a boat conductor. The crux of the film is a series of incidents that take place in her life over three days due to a small incident.

Any preparations for the role in Oruthee?
I had permanent golden highlights on my hair and I was very much fond of it. But as part of my look for Oruthee, I had to remove that. Also, I am learning the working style of the boat conductors. I feel happy and contented to be acting again.


What was it like to take a break in your acting career all these years?
A proper artiste will always have a desire to give a spectacular performance. The question is about the time and place for it. That is a personal decision to be taken by individuals and I chose now. Everyone can inspire themselves to perform. It is only in Malayalam films that actresses face the pre-marriage and post-marriage acting categorisation. No other industry focuses on these criteria as actresses keep performing, while managing the timely and natural changes that happen in their lives.
I think the same should be applicable here too, there should not be a question over the careers of actresses before or after marriage or after she turns a mother. These should be treated as natural changes in her life. I believe that change is taking place and the new generation of actors in Malayalam will not be affected by these criteria in the future.


Did you think there is an increase in women-oriented films nowadays in Malayalam?
No, there isn’t. There are still very few such, compared to the powerful women-centric films played by veteran actresses, such as Sheela and Sharada.

How important is dance for you?
The most important element that strengthened me is dance. When life quietened down for me, dance has played a major role to keep me engaged. Dance is like the oxygen I breathe.

Tell us about the changes that Mumbai brought to your life?
Mumbai made me health-conscious and made exercise a part of my life. The very first thing that comes to mind about Mumbai is the health-conscious people and their determination to keep healthy through exercise. Also, it has heightened my fashion sense. The golden highlight was an outcome of that; it was my first ever experiment on my hair.

Can you share your secret mantra of a healthy body?

(Laughs) I dedicate my time to functional training and cross-fit exercises. There is no easy route to your goal, so I do daily workouts and take an effort to keep fit.


Tell us about your son, Sai Krishna.

Sai is my life. I am his mamma and he is my vava. We usually hang out for films, dining and sometimes shopping too. He is my main companion and we spend time planning events and our hangouts. My vava is a very understanding child, beyond his years. He is also the typical naughty character like any boy of his age, but he is also easy to control.


Any new projects other than Oruthee?

At present it is only this film. I feel blessed that many still enjoy my Balamani role and am happy that it is an evergreen character in the hearts of many."

Whether I’m shooting or not, come Makar Sankranti and I make my way back to my native place. I have been flying kites on this festival since childhood and now feel like a professional kite-flyer. I cut more than 250 kites every year, which puts me in a happy space. But I make sure to use safe manjha (thread). Also, I love binging on homemade til ka laddoo, chikki to churma, aloo vada and dal bafla.

Helly Shah

I have grown up in Ahmedabad, but I never learnt how to fly kites. During Uttarayan in Gujarat, it was always exciting to go to the terrace and watch the colourful sky. Undhiyu, chikki and laddoos are my favourites and I wait to gorge on them.
Aastha Chaudhary
Cutting others’ kites is a skill I excel at. Earlier, Makar Sankranti used to be a family affair, but today, it’s more about getting fancy kites and arranging a DJ set-up. I still go and steal kites as I would as a kid.

Karan Patel
For me, this festival is about letting the child in me out. My cousins drop by and we have a good time, flying kites. My mother does a small puja and a havan in the morning and the night ends with scrumptious food and great company.

Karanvir Bohra
I have some great memories attached to this festival. Flying kites had always been one of the fun activities as a child – hopping from one rooftop to another, cutting each other’s kites in a competition etc. This Makar Sankranti, too, I’ll be flying kites with friends and gorging on sarson ka saag.

Rohitashv Gour
Besides the puja and rituals, I love eating gud gajak with peanuts. My most special memory from the time spent in my hometown Kalka is engaging in a competition with my neighbour. He was famous for making people lose at kite-flying. However, call it a stroke of luck or the Gods favouring me, he lost and co-incidentally on one Makar Sankranti. The bet was that whoever loses had to throw a party and he had to do it that evening.

Harsh Rajput
I have so many fond memories of celebrating this festival in Navsari, Gujarat, where I was born. All the terraces and grounds in the neighbourhood would be filled with children flying colourful kites. We would have so much fun.

Deepika Singh
We celebrate Makar Sankranti with great fervour in my hometown, Delhi. My husband, Rohit Raj Goyal’s family also celebrates the festival with as much gusto. Since according to the ritual, til ki mithai comes from the girl’s side, I wait for my mom-made laddoos just as I would while I was growing up. This year, I would like to fly kites with my son Soham.

Divyanka Tripathi
Even though I have tried kite-flying as a kid, I really learnt it with my co-actors on the set of my show, Mrs & Mr Sharma Allahaba-dwale. This festival is beautiful and a lot of fun.

Siddharth Arora
Even today, whenever I can, I celebrate the festival in my hometown (Benaras). After flying kites, we play cricket on the terrace. It’s an annual ritual, which I look forward to.

Sonyaa Ayodhya
Flying kites has always fascinated me, but it should not cause any harm to birds. Festivals are supposed to bring joy, not sorrow. That’s why I request everyone not to use glass-coated manjha; instead, use
uncoated cotton strings.

Mudit Nayar

This year, I hope to visit my hometown Delhi. My brother got married recently and we want to show my sister-in-law the way we celebrate the festival at home. I also want to gorge on homemade til laddoos, mithai and enjoy the winter after so many years. The kid in me is waiting to take over.


Mohsin Khan

Celebrating Sankranti with my cousins in Nadiad (Gujarat), where I was born, was fun. I remember how we would fly kites and then rush downstairs to grab them and shout, ‘Kai po che’. Now, my work does not permit me to go there, but I am craving for the til ke laddoos.


Aniruddh Dave

Like the last eight years, I will be in Surat to celebrate it with my friends. We host parties on the terrace and fly kites. My father is a pro at flying kites and I learnt it from him. I make sure that the thread I use doesn’t harm birds."

Now, singer-actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi gave an example of Anurag Kashyap while explaining things to an internet user. While talking about nepotism, she stated that one has to prove themselves rather than insulting others for being born in a celebrity family. She added that one needs to work on themselves instead of resenting others.

In the next tweet, she wrote that Anurag Kashyap is the example of what she said. She tweeted, ""Example of my last tweet being #AnuragKashyap . Bhai apna kaam first dhang se Karo - sacred games aur ghost stories jaise bakwaas banaate ho. Failure digest nahi hota isliye #PMModi ko insult Karne me lage ho. It's twisted .""
In the following tweet, she posted, ""Everybody is entitled to dissent & protest & opinion. But a decorum & conduct must be maintained if we aspire to a civilized society. Gutter talk & abusive language may be fashionable in a certain brand of alternate Cinema - but it must not become a norm in public discourse.""

"Created: Jan 15, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Pankhuri Awasthy: A point came when I stopped relating to my character in 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai',"There had been several speculations about actress Pankhuri Awasthy quitting 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai' ('YRKKH') during the course of her track on the show, which she joined in June 2019, to play Vedika. And her journey finally came to an end recently. Pankhuri tells TOI, “It was a short and sweet journey. 'YRKKH' was offered to me around the same time when I was auditioning for a film. Initially, my track was scheduled for three months and I took it up, as it would have been completed by the time I had to shoot for the film. However, my role was extended owing to the ratings.”
She adds, “My track was shaping up well. However, it slipped towards the end and I just couldn’t relate to it. Besides, the ratings after my re-entry (after the break when she was shooting for the film) didn’t match up. Though the character had an edge, it became redundant. Since it made no sense to leave the show abruptly, I continued doing it.”

The actress received a lot of flak for playing a negative character. She says, “During the course of my track, I received a lot of flak from viewers on my social media handles. Some even got personal. However, I didn’t mind it, as I got to explore a lot of shades while playing the part.”

But, isn’t turning negative after playing a series of positive characters a challenge and also a risk, as it can get an actor stereotyped? Pankhuri replies, “I was apprehensive initially, but Vedika’s actions were triggered by her emotions. Also, I was told that the character would be justified on the show.”


Post 'YRKKH', the actress is clear that she wants to play only lead roles. She explains, “I will take up only lead roles now. I don’t mind playing a negative character, if the

story revolves around her and her actions are justified.”


A few weeks ago, in an interview with TOI, her husband, actor Gautam Rode, had expressed the desire to go the family way in 2020. Ask her about it and she says, “Well, if he said that, he couldn’t have decided without me (smiles!). On a serious note, we have been thinking about it and are on the same page when it comes to starting a family. Gautam and I had decided that we would start a family after two years of marriage, which we will be completing soon. I am prepared for motherhood now. I am not overambitious, and I want my professional and personal life to coexist peacefully.”"

"Created: Jan 15, 2020, 01:00 IST",Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"11th Death Anniversary: Remembering Tapan Sinha, the humane storyteller","Tapan Sinha was one of those filmmakers for whom commercial success and critical acclaim came hand in hand and his demise on January 15, 2009 marked an end to a glorious chapter of Indian cinema. It was an end of an era in Bengali cinema. The 84-year-old director of timeless classics like ‘Kabuliwala’ (1957), ‘Khudito Pashan’ (1960), ‘Jatugriha’ (1964), ‘Harmonium’ (1976), ‘Bancharamer Bagan’ (1980) and ‘Ek Doctor ki Maut’ (1991) breathed his last after prolonged illness. It’s the master filmmaker’s 11 th death anniversary and he still lives on in the memories.
Hailed by contemporaries and looked up to by successive generations of directors, Tapan Sinha belonged to a rare breed of film-makers for whom commercial success and critical acclaim came hand in hand. Mrinal Sen who had started making films around the same time as Tapan Sinha, had once said Tapan Sinha was the finest “middle-of-the-road” film-maker in the country. “We differed in many ways and I did not agree with him all the time, but that does not mean that I do not consider him one of the finest directors in India. I have also never found a human being as good and as powerful as Tapan Sinha,” Sen had told in an interview.

Born on October 2, 1924, in Kolkata, Tapan Sinha had his early sources of inspiration from American and British films, particularly those of Billy Wilder, John Ford and Carol Reed. After his graduation in Physics from the University of Calcutta, Tapan Sinha started his film career as a sound engineer in 1946. Around 1950, he got the opportunity to work under director Charles Cryton in London. Upon his return to India in 1952 he took up direction, and his first film ‘Ankush’ was released in 1954.
In the next 50 years, Tapan Sinha made 40 films, won several national and international awards, including the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2008 for his outstanding contribution to Indian cinema. He was married to acclaimed Bengali film actor Arundhuti Devi, who passed away in 1994.

Tapan Sinha was a versatile craftsman. It is impossible to categorise his films in any particular genre or tradition. He constantly shifted from period pieces (‘Jhinder Bandi’, ‘Khudito Pashan) to children’s films (‘Safed Haathi’, ‘Aaj ka Robinhood’) to comedies (‘Bancharamer Bagan’), to social issues (‘Ek Doctor ki Maut’, ‘Adalat O Ekti Meye’), serving to the tastes of practically every section of cinema-goers.

Soumitra Chatterjee had once said: “As far as variety of subject and theme is concerned, Tapan Sinha can only be compared with Satyajit Ray. He never repeated himself; there was always a new subject that he addressed.” Soumitra Chatterjee also considers it his “great fortune” that the very second film in his career was Tapan Sinha’s ‘Khudito Pashan’ (The Hungry Stone) in 1960.

“In the last 50 years he was not only my friend, but also a great teacher. I don’t know any other person apart from Satyajit Ray who has had such an influence on my career as an actor. He was a humanist, and I admire that aspect of him immensely. He started as a mainstream film director and grew into someone who beautifully told stories of human concern,” adds Soumitra.

Tapan Sinha was a consummate and gifted storyteller, and his craft was characterised by his serious treatment of even popular themes. His was essentially an artistic sensibility working within a popular format. Like Charles Chaplin and Billy Wilder, Tapan Sinha’s technique was essentially linear narration, with no fancy or avant-garde distractions. He could produce effects and dramatic tension using standard techniques and without resorting to idiosyncrasies.

His stories dealt with human struggle against all barriers, like the paternal affection of an old Afghan merchant for a Bengali Hindu child (‘Kabuliwala’); or the humanistic concern of a Muslim vagabond for an ailing Hindu stranger (‘Aadmi aur Aurat’). Apart from Satyajit Ray, he was the only director who took an active interest in making films for children, which managed to transcend the age barrier and move adults also.

He could address one theme after another with masterly ease. The same masterly touch was noticeable in the music and sound effects of his films. Kabuliwala had won the music award at the Berlin Film Festival.

He was representing “reformist” sensibility in Bengali cinema in the 1950s and 1960s, keeping at bay the influence of Bollywood masala formulas that engulfed the Indian film industry, and essentially catering to the taste of the middle-class Bengali audience. It was directors like Tapan Sinha and his uncompromising adherence to his own style that helped the Bengali industry retain its individuality for two decades.

When the thrust of the Indian film industry was on feudal family melodrama, Tapan Sinha’s focus was on the problems of the middle class in the urban context. There was none of the cheap imitations of the vulgar song and dance routines and potboiler ingredients in his movies.


Alongside Satyajit Ray, Tapan Sinha was one of the few directors who brilliantly adapted popular and great literature into films. The works of Rabindranath Tagore to Tara Shankar Bandopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Banaphool, and Subodh Ghosh were recreated by him on the big screen, and never failed to grab audience attention.


Even when the “great trio” (Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, and Mrinal Sen) reigned supreme, it was a common sight in Kolkata to see large queues outside cinema halls, in pouring rain, when a Tapan Sinha film was released. Such was his charisma!


On his 11 th death anniversary, we pay our homage to the master filmmaker!"

"Created: Jan 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",Deepa Soman,Entertainment,Aditi Balan: Padavettu’s set is quite young and comfortable like that of my first movie Aruvi,"Her debut film was the Tamil project Aruvi, but Aditi Balan impressed many even outside the language through her performance in the film. After two years, the half Malayali- half Tamilian girl is now starting out in Malayalam too, with two plum projects in her kitty – Nivin Pauly starrer Padavettu and Kunchacko Boban’s Kolkata-based project, replacing Nithya Menen! Aditi, who has been shooting in Kannur, shares with us more about her decision to work in Malayalam and more.

Your debut was in 2017 and you picked your second film only now. What was the cause for the long break?

The shoot of Aruvi was over in 2016 and so, it’s been three years since my first project. Quite a few Tamil projects were offered to me, but none of them interested me much. The reason was that I didn’t want to be typecast as an artiste who does only female-oriented projects or those similar to my debut film. Moreover, I am someone who landed in tinsel-ville by chance, without ever dreaming of getting into the industry. So, I didn’t feel compelled to take up anything immediately. I wanted to make sure that the film that I take up next excites me. So, I waited and that’s when Padavettu came my way.

Tell us how Padavettu was offered to you and about your role.
Last year, when the makers of Padavettu got in touch with me for the film, I was in Pondicherry with a theatre group named Adi Shakti, doing a workshop. There was no audition, they got in touch as they had seen my debut movie. Director Liju Krishna came over to meet me and narrated the script. Since then, we have been in touch and then I gave my confirmation. I felt that the script of this movie was simple, yet very impactful. As for the character, all I can say now is that she is quite a mature person.


The film is based in Kannur and you are paired with Nivin Pauly
Yes, and we have been shooting there for a while. I reached Kannur almost a week before the shoot began, just to understand the place and language better. We shot for about 10 days in December and now, the second schedule is on, in Mattannur.
Being a half Malayali, I can handle the language but I find the Kannur slang quite challenging to understand as the people here speak fast and cut many words short. I have also been spending time with people here, rather than sitting in caravans or rooms. There is also someone who comes to teach me the language.

That said, the set has been quite comfortable with young people and it reminds me of the first film’s set. I was a bit nervous at first, but by the third day, I was fine.

Nivin is very chilled on the sets, and is quite cooperative even when I have to go for retakes. And even to others around, he doesn’t act like he is a big star.

Not many people know about your Malayalam connections
Though I grew up in Chennai, my mom is from Mavelikara. My dad is from Chennai. We used to come here for vacations and for a few years in my childhood, we were based here. I remember going to watch Malayalam movies with my parents in my childhood. It’s with my friends that I started going for Tamil films. I have always been a huge Lalettan fan. I also had a soft corner for Jayaram sir as I always felt he looks a lot like my dad. Now, I am also learning to read and write the language.


We get to see you in a small sequence in Ajith-Trisha starrer Yennai Arinthal. How did that happen?

Well, from my childhood, I have been learning bharathanatyam and I have been a classical dancer. My aunt’s daughter also learns bharathanatyam with me and someone told her that the team of Yennai Arinthal wants two dancers with good height. That’s how I went for it. I was supposed to be there only for the bharathanatyam scene, but later, Gautam Menon sir asked me to be also part of a small sequence in which Trisha appears with two of her friends, in a song. I am there for hardly five seconds and I had to pause a million times to see me (laughs). At that time, I didn’t have any clue that I would be an actor one day.


Is that how you landed a role in Aruvi as well?

While I was a student, I was mostly into athletics in school and football in college, and played for our university too. And then there was dance. Though I was interested, I never got to do theatre. After finishing my graduation in LLB, I felt I should take a break and try theatre. While I was there, I was told that Aruvi’s casting is done by one of my co-artiste’s friends and that’s how I went for it. I feel I didn’t give the audition very well as I was very new to the experience. They had auditioned over 400 people, but shortlisted me. I was also asked to go for a one-day test shoot in which they made me do the basic emotions, expressions and more, which were all shot. And then, I was selected.


Tell us about your Kunchacko Boban starrer.

We were supposed to start with the film’s shoot, but at the moment, its shooting is delayed."

A month ago, BT reported that lead actor Mohit Malik was planning to quit the show, which was set to take a time leap. He had said, “I am not convinced that I can play father to a grown-up actor and so my journey will be over in Kulfi....”

Meanwhile, the channel has taken a decision to wrap up the show; the last episode will end in the first week of February. Producer Nilanjana Purkayasstha confirmed the news. She said, “Yes, the show is going off air. We were planning a leap and wanted to take the story forward. Our team felt that there was still scope to explore Kulfi’s story further, but sometimes things don’t go as planned.”"
"Created: Jan 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",KAVYA CHRISTOPHER,Entertainment,"'Physical injuries can be dealt with, it’s back-stabbing that really hurt'","After over two decades and an enviable repertoire of work behind him, Kannada star Kichcha Sudeep tells us he is lucky to be in the space that he is in today. “I am lucky to have people still writing roles specifically for me,” he says, as he settles in for a chat about his life now and the way ahead…
With Dabangg 3, and your other Kannada films, has the year gone by brought in a change in direction in your career?
There can’t be a change in career at this point. There has been a career. That way, I am lucky to be having a career like this in the first place. I guess after this point, it’s about extensions, extra feathers, extra excitement that keeps coming your way. Sometimes that doesn’t happen and that’s what we need to worry about, because life becomes monotonous. There is no journey. There is one that took place, and once you reach the destination, you tend to just be there… stagnate. It has been a journey for me, but luckily mine has not stopped. Even though there has been no deliberate attempt or plan or strategy, I continue to travel and go with the flow. If there’s a vehicle to pick me up, I just get in. Everything that has been happening has come by itself; some things I have co-ordinated and carried out, while others, I have let go. Either ways, I am happy with both. Luckily for me, there has been some excitement every year. Dabangg 3 happened last year, but more than films, it excites me to work with new people, experience new places and things.

Being in a space that you never imagined you would ever be a part of, excites me. It is not about carrying baggage from your past and saying, ‘I want to do the things I have been doing back home, here as well’. It was a new experience, even though I played the antagonist. I did play a negative role in Eega, but then there was no hero to beat me up. This is about acceptance. You have accepted the role, and you need to do it whole-heartedly. I was lucky that despite there being so many people, I got my piece of cake. I came back home with a name for myself.
Your role was spoken about, even though it was a Salman Khan film...
The team gave me my space and didn’t edit or delete portions of my role, which goes to show that they respected my presence. That is probably why they wanted me to do the role. There are instances in the film for which Salman sir has written my lines. There is a scene in which I walk into a hospital and speak, and he just stands there and listens to me. This is rare, for a hero to not react to what is being thrown at him. It had happened in Kempegowda too — where Aramugam (played by P Ravishankar) walks into the police station, speaks and leaves, while I just stand there. That is bowing down to the requirement of the scene, and not doing anything extra to show that you are the hero. That made the character of Arumugam. And that is what happened with Dabangg 3 as well. If the character I played is etched in people’s minds today, I owe it to the team. They could have easily tweaked or edited out bits of the performance. They did not do that and have been sweet.

The bond between you and the team has continued, especially with Salman Khan...
Whenever you meet genuine people, and there is no agenda attached to how they are with you, bonds are bound to be created. Everybody has enough experience to understand whether, or not, there is an agenda to a connection. Maybe we do not speak about it openly, but we just know it. But when you just like the other person’s presence in your life, with zero expectations, then you start cherishing the time spent together. I have never asked him (Salman) to do anything for me. If he comes to meet me here, it has to happen organically, and not because I have called him. We text each other, and are in constant touch. It is nice when one gets a response from people who you least expect to even know. Salman too reacts to people. He has seen all kinds of people — the good and the bad. So, when he stays connected with people, then that means it is something nice.

What’s 2020 looking like?
I am looking forward to the release of Kotigobba 3. I am also excited about my new film, Phantom, to be directed by Anup Bhandari. We are doing a trial shoot to test the look and feel for this film. It should go on floors after the Bigg Boss Kannada finale; probably by the first week of February. Phantom is a thriller, the narrative of which takes place a few years in the past. It is set in a time when there was minimal commuting and communication and that brings the thrill factor to the forefront. Content-wise, it is a subject that has touched me. It is not a typical film and is new for me. The film will be shot on sets and the aim is to make a visually fabulous movie. Anup and I were to work on Billa Ranga Bhasha. But then, he shared this script with me and asked for feedback. I felt we needed to do this first. This film was not written for me, but I was drawn to the content, which is out-of-the-box. I want to do such films.

Content-driven films also mean lower budgets. Has that changed after you came into the picture?
It can’t be low budget anymore, right? My remuneration is already huge. But on a serious note, we discussed Phantom and I took it to another level. I insisted that there should be no changes to the story just because I am a part of it. The content is beautiful, so it was important to keep it that way, and not fill the storyline with unnecessary elements. The story should remain the way it is. What matters is having a vision about presentation– what you want to shoot at one location, should look like say… the Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is not just about creating that area, or place. The team has been working on this for almost a year now. Many shoot floors have already been booked for over six months since set work is in process at all these locations.

You have gone out of your way to present yourself differently in your recent films. What sort of a look are you working on for this one?
Frankly, I have never worked on a new look for a script, I have done that for myself. There’s nothing in a script that connects it to how I should present myself onscreen. The audience does not come to watch a film with an idea of how the character in the film should look. The look is what an actor offers to his audience. I feel good if I am able to offer something new. When I see the poster of my film, if nothing apart from the title and the costumes I wear is different from my previous poster, then, for me, it is a personal disaster. I put in an effort, but by doing so I also cut down the momentum of my work too, because you can only do one film at a time. Luckily, that has worked out that way for me.

What’s next, after Phantom?
There are many interesting projects that keep coming up, but I like to keep my book open because anything exciting can come up suddenly. It makes no sense to hurry up with things that excite you, as things may go wrong, by which time you find yourself too deep in it. I should be in a position where I can pull back anytime. If things are not working out fine, I do get practical about it and step out. What happens is that you tend to succumb to commitment — if you have taken a rupee, you are committed. I don’t take money till a point when I can see how a team is getting ahead with a promised script. If it is going the right way, where everyone on the team wakes up with one intention — to make a good film — then I am in for the long haul. There are a lot of projects that are being discussed right now. I am very happy that I wake up with confidence each day, because there are people out there who are still writing stories for me. That’s what has always kept me alive; not my hits, but the writers who are writing for me as it gives me a lot of security.

You have announced a directorial too...
Yes, I have; I want to do something. I have always directed my films at regular intervals. This time around, there has been a long gap. Telling a story has always excited me more than just being a part of it. I want to narrate a story now and plan to start this mid-year.

Over the last few years, you have had a series of injuries, be it on the set or on the field, thanks to your passion for cricket. Which of them have been the most tough to recover from?
Physical injuries can be dealt with. There is always a cure, and you know that it is going to be fixed. Back-stabbing hurts more; there is no medicine or cure for it and you just need to accept it. It usually comes from very beautiful places and sources you least expect it from. Those injuries have been far more. It has only made me look at everything in a different way right now. Things don’t hurt me anymore. Accept that apology that does not come, and go easy on yourself. That works out better. Anger is a very pure emotion, much stronger than love. Irrespective of whether you wake up thinking about your loved ones or not, you will surely wake up thinking about this person you are angry with. You should not allow someone to occupy that kind of space in your mind; it is not worth it. It’s better to forget about it.
See, I am not here to prove a point to anyone. Life is treating me well. What more does one want? What is success to me? Today, I can go buy what I want and go where I want. I am also in a position to help people around me. Earlier, all this needed to be planned. Today, I can. And that is success for me. I don’t want to compare myself with someone else; I am out of that zone. I am quite sorted with what I have in life. But that does not mean it is over. My competitiveness towards certain things won’t stop. My Friday challenges (film releases) will still remain. I don’t intend to overtake anybody in life. But I will always protect what I am doing. I have been invaded, and that has only made me more cautious. I am not vindictive, though, and I will never do what others have done to me. I have learnt where the loopholes are. For instance, having a kingdom does not mean that we need to be at war all the time. We just need to protect our fort. I am happy with what I have and I am learning to protect it.
Do you find yourself not being able to trust new people?
It is better not to trust. All the people who you trusted are still around. You are here for professional reasons, there is no need to go out of your way to trust someone, unless it happens organically. But you can still be nice to each other. You need to know where to place new people in your life all of a sudden. But if you give someone a place of priority, and then crib about it — that does not make sense. Trusting them in the first place is your mistake. Nobody asked you to trust them. You need to know where you position them. If you see your life as a game, say, a chess board, you need to position people in the right place and need all the pawns to play your game right.

They say it gets lonely at the top. Do you believe that?
They also say beware what you wish for. We aim big, wanting to get to a certain space, but we never ask how many people are travelling to this space with you. It is not about how many are going in the same direction. It is about an individual aim and journey. The journey becomes about individual achievements — about I, I and I. You finally reach the top of Mount Everest and put up your flag and realise that there is nobody else with you there. It’s okay. But let’s take the positive side of this, not everybody can do that also. And after a while, it is better if you are by yourself. The world is a much more peaceful place that way. It gets lonely at the top; there are fewer people left with you, but that is the norm of life.

You have turned philosophical. Are you reading or following anything in particular?
You wake up in the morning and life teaches you all that you need to learn. I am a bad reader, I don’t read books. But education comes from the least expected sources. My learning has always been from my life, and my experiences, not from anybody else’s philosophy. If you look for it, you will get your own lesson in life. We can all write our books, just that I am not interested.

How about writing that book?
I have said this before, I will lead a life worth writing a book about some day. I don’t want to write about it. Others may find it interesting, somehow, and if they do, they might set about writing it — with a proper interpretation I hope.

ON SUPPORTING CINEMA
aI cannot say that I know everything that is happening in the industry, because I am not aware. The ones I am aware of, I get to know due to the small effort from my side to see what people want to show me and a huge effort from them to show me what they have done. People come home and I take time to watch their work, and even given whatever feedback that comes to my mind. If they think that my presence is going to help them in any way, then I do make that effort — as long as it is helping somebody.

BENGALURU VS HYDERABAD
Living in both the cities is about what one is trying to cater to. I want to cater to cinema. Bengaluru is my hometown and I love it, but the resources required for what I am catering to do not match up now. There is traffic and a scarcity of studios. The scale of the project being made also needs to be taken into consideration. Availability of locations here does not depend on your seniority or stardom, it is on a first-come-first-service basis. That’s why I am looking at working in Hyderabad, where there are a lot of resources. I am only trying to make my film look better, richer — at the same cost. It is not about liking or loving a place for any particular reason; it is about what works best.

ON CRICKET
Cricket has and will always be a part of my life. There have been a lot of speed breaks on that journey though. The moment something takes off, something else happens and we slow down again. But we always play the game, even if it is over a weekend; we have at least one match every month. We missed out on the Karnataka Chalanachitra Cup last year because of certain issues — unavailability of the grounds and some of the players. It was supposed to take place in January this year, but the ongoing police inquiry into the official game has delayed our plans too. There is again a scarcity of space. We have a window again in August-September this year. We are working towards a tournament then — if it works, it works.

ON SKETCHING SALMAN

I used to paint, and I still do. More recently, I did a sketch of Salman. I wanted to give it to him on his birthday. I still have not, because on that day there was too much of a crowd. I will give it to him one of these days. There are certain people you really don’t know what to gift, and they don’t expect anything either. But at the same time, you can’t give them anything that they don’t already have. It has happened in my friend’s circle as well. But I think it is the presence and the thought that really matters. It is not that I don’t like gifts, but I don’t want people to buy anything big either. It is the small gestures that matter. So, what I could think of as a gift for Salman was this sketch.


ON HIS PASSION FOR COOKING

I love cooking. I keep cooking for people. I enjoy the process. Only baking takes a little more time and a lot of precision. It is only when you start baking that you feel bad for all the bakers in town. When you bake a bun, you realise how long it takes and the precision needed in the process of getting there. Once you have done that, you also respect what you buy from bakers. I do bake a lot. While people are busy buying souvenirs during their travels, at any new place, local food and ingredients top my shopping list. I buy the special spices and sauces available in that country, as well as traditional utensils that they use. I buy them, as that makes a difference in the authenticity of creating the dish. I do want to start an exclusive restaurant, once I retire — a quaint small place with five or six tables. I will cook and say this is my dish for the day. I don’t want to depend on it for my income, but I just want to have something like that out there because it gives me pleasure. It will probably be at a place where people will come to the restaurant, not for me, but for the food, because I don’t want to encash in on my popularity as an actor for this. So, it may not even be in this country, I don’t know. Let’s see."

When we finally got through to him, he was on a day off for Sankranti, celebrating the festival with family. So, how many films is he working on currently? “There are seven or eight films,” Chikkanna says and begins rattling off names, adding, “I think I have done close to 200 films in my nine years in the industry, so, my next goal is to turn hero. In fact, director-actor Manju Mandavya, with whom I am co-starring in this week’s Sri Bharatha Bahubali, is making my debut as hero. We have agreed on the basic premise of the story, but it is yet to be developed into a full-fledged script. I am looking at finishing my current acting commitments and then concentrating on my transition to protagonist,” says Chikkanna. Does that mean that his days as a comedian are over? “It really depends on whether audiences accept me as a hero. The truth is that most supporting actors who have made the transition successfully don’t ever return to their roots. While I do want to be a hero, I know that comedy is my strong suit and will work on films in that genre. I have no illusions that I can pass off for a romantic hero. I will do what suits me,” says the actor.

Up next, though, is Sri Bharatha Bahubali, which, while introducing Manju as hero, has Chikkanna in a role that qualifies as second lead. “For a long time now, I have only been doing films in which I have had fairly substantial roles in terms of screen presence and characterization, like, for instance, the hero’s friend. In Sri Bharatha Bahubali, I am Bahubali, Bharatha’s friend. We are village lads, whose chance encounter with the heroine, Sri, and the journey they undertake, forms the crux of the story,” he explains."

We feel scared and unsafe,” said students of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Yelahanka, a day after some political workers, led by the local MLA, reportedly raised concerns over graffiti on a wall outside the school gate, ‘creating a ruckus’ near the campus. According to the workers, the two portraits were reportedly “cartoonish and insulting”, and they blamed the students for having put them up.

The students, however, said that the matter didn’t end there. Questions were also raised about the institution’s dress code and vehicle parking rules. On condition of anonymity, a female student said, “We always park our vehicles outside the school, and so do our faculty members. No one has ever objected to that earlier. But, on Tuesday, questions were asked about what we wear to college and where we park our vehicles. This, we felt, was an instance of moral policing, and not just a concern about the art work.”


Adding to this, another student said, “In fact, the school management has sent out a circular asking students not to attend classes for three days, until the situation returns to normalcy. We have also been instructed not to move around in a group. Although, there is no confirmation on who has painted the graffiti yet, the MLA claims that there are CCTV cameras installed, and that they are watching us 24X7. The very thought that someone is keeping an eye on you is scary and disturbing.” “We have always been taught about the importance of free thinking and freedom of expression. But when such incidents take place at our own campus, it makes us question everything that we are taught,” say the students."

Maharashtra is considering making both the films tax-free, as per Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat, who said, ""Earlier, the Revenue ministry used to take a decision on making a movie tax-free, but now the tax has been subsumed in the GST."" Since GST (Goods and Services Tax) came into effect, what exactly does a film's tax-free status mean?


In December 2018, two GST slabs were announced for films – 18% for tickets above Rs 100, and 12% for tickets below Rs 100. This tax is divided between the state and central government (State GST and Central GST). When a state declares a film 'tax-free', now it exempts only half of the entertainment tax, which would be either 9% or 6%, as per the ticket price. For the multiplex audience, since there are hardly any tickets available below Rs 100, the default exemption would be 9%. Cinema hall owners say that declaring a film tax-free had a bigger impact in the pre-GST years, when every state had different entertainment tax and the state governments could exempt the whole amount. Now, a moviegoer still needs to pay Central GST even for tax-exempted films. With GST in play, now the tax-free status of a film means endorsement of a film by the state government, rather than any significant monetary benefit."
"Created: Jan 16, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,Entertainment,Malang’s romantic title track has a Sufi touch,"After the melodious Chal Ghar Chalen, the makers of 'Malang' are set to release the film’s title track today. The Sufi number, featuring Disha Patani and Aditya Roy Kapur, is penned by Kunaal Vermaa and Haarsh Limbhachiyaa. Director Mohit Suri says, “This song captures the theme of the film perfectly. It’s one of those tracks that will instantly strike a chord with the listeners.”

Ved Sharma, who has composed and sung the track, says, “It is a vibrant and romantic number with a Sufi touch. A lot of inspiration for this song was drawn from one of Amir Khusro’s dohas; there’s a deep meaning to his words. The biggest challenge for me was to bring out Aditya’s character through the song. Mohit sir wanted the vocal tone to match that of Aditya’s as well as the vibe of the character he plays in the film.” The film also stars Anil Kapoor and Kunal Kemmu.


Haarsh, who has been mostly associated with stand-up comedy shows on TV, says, “Not many people know that I am a lyricist as well. When the news about the song surfaced, many asked me whether the song was in the comic or serious genre.” Talking about the Sufi touch lent to the song, he says, “Sufi gaano ki toh baat hi alag hoti hai. Maine jaise hi iss gaane ki dhunn suni main genuinely iss gaane ka fan ho gaya tha. This song is soulful, and there is another version of it in the film, which is trance and party mix. So, there are two moods — tandav and yog.”

Kunaal, who has previously written songs like Hasi Ban Gaye ('Hamari Adhuri Kahani') and Lost Without You ('Half Girlfriend'), says, “This is my hat-trick with Mohit sir. He wanted a few words to be incorporated in the song, but at the same time, told me ki jaisa aur jis mood mein likhna hai likho. The title track is about surprises and adventures life throws when you are travelling.”"

Dhaor@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,From choosing homestays and public transport to carrying your own cutlery and toiletries: Make your trips eco-friendly,"The year 2017 was designated by the United Nations as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. Two years later, in 2019, it became one of the biggest travel trends across the world. In August that year, Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg refused to take an aeroplane, which contributes to atmospheric carbon pollution, and sailed across the Atlantic – she travelled by a sailboat from Plymouth, England, to attend a UN summit in New York, US – putting climate crisis and sustainable travelling in the spotlight. But according to a global survey conducted by a leading digital travel platform, 37% respondents agreed that they do not know how to travel sustainably. If travelling tops your new year resolution's list and you have started mapping your escapes, here is a ready-reckoner you can refer to make your trips eco-friendly.

Aim for a zero-waste experience

As a sustainable traveller, one should aim for a zero-waste experience. Using disposable tissues and toiletries at hotels and stays generate waste which eventually ends up adding to the garbage pile. ""I travelled to Jageshwar Dham (Uttarakhand) and carried wooden tooth brush, shampoo and toothpaste. We asked the hotel staff to take away the disposable toiletries from the room,"" says Madhu Mittal, a member of a residents' group in Noida, which leads anti-plastic campaigns and promotes sustainability.
Rashi Grover, who leads an initiative in her locality in Green Park, which promotes waste-segregation and discourages littering, adds, ""We carry our own hand towels in bags which we keep washing and reusing throughout our journey. Though paper tissues are considered eco-friendly, they still generate waste which we want to avoid.""

'In the past 1 year, queries for environment-friendly stays have doubled'
In order to ensure an eco-friendly stay, Nishand Venugopal, another Delhi resident, does an extensive research before embarking on a trip. He says, ""I always look for a stay which incorporates environment-friendly practices and is constructed of mud rather than concrete. Being a birder, I also ensure that the location of the hotel or stay is not in hindrance with the natural animal habitat of the region.""

Supriya Sardana, who promotes sustainability in her locality in Noida through campaigns and workshops, says that she opts for homestays rather than hotels. ""I prefer homestays as they do not contribute to wastage of single-use plastics and other fancies which hotels do.""

Prerna, who is also the founder of an eco-friendly travel agency, adds that there has been a rise in the number of people preferring to stay at environment-friendly stays. ""All our stays are mud constructions and the areas have over 30% green cover. In the past one year, queries for environment-friendly stays have doubled, with many opting for places which indulge environment-friendly practices like rainwater harvesting, growing own veggies and avoiding use of single-use plastic products, among other things,"" she tells us.

Travellers are keen on sustainable holidays
55% of global travellers report being more determined to make sustainable travel choices than they were a year ago, but barriers include a lack of knowledge and appealing options when trying to put this into practice
41%request travel companies to offer tips on how to be more sustainable while travelling
68% would like the money they spend on travel to go back into the local community
52%global travellers say they now alter behaviours to be more sustainable while travelling, such as walking, riding a bike or hiking whenever possible
72% global travellers are seeking authentic experiences that are representative of the local culture
56% respondents say that if there was an option to offset the carbon footprint on their vacation accommodation, they would do it

Take public transport
Though a road trip with friends in your own car may entice you to have your own 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' moment, it is not the best option when you are trying to reduce carbon footprint. ""Travelling by bus or train is an eco-friendly option for sustainable travellers. Though not all carbon emissions can be avoided, taking a public conveyance can at least distribute the emissions,"" says Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist from Greater Noida.

Bring the trash back
Ensure that you bring back any trash that is generated while travelling and recycle it. ""Even after trying our best, some trash was generated on our two-day trip to Dehradun. This included a couple of tissue papers, two paper plates and two chips wrappers, which my kids insisted on having. I brought them back home to make an eco-brick out of it,"" says Sameera Satija, a Gurgaon resident, who started a steel crockery bank in 2018.
An eco-brick is a concept which recycles plastic bottles and trash paper or wrappers. ""We stuff the plastic bottles with all the trash until its full, so it becomes solid as a bricks. These eco-bricks have multiple uses. I have made some dividers in my lawn and a dog-house out of them,"" adds Sameera.


Use your own cutlery
Whether it is a cup of tea, a water bottle, or plates and spoons, carry your own cutlery whenever on a vacation. ""Apart from cutlery and steel water bottle, I always carry home-cooked food to avoid eating in disposables. In India, the traditional dhabas are by and large zero-waste as they use stainless steel so we prefer to eat there,"" says Supriya.

Sameera adds, ""I have my own set of stainless steel cutlery that I use whenever we eat at any place which serves food in disposables,"" Her cutlery pouch includes stainless steel straws, spoons and forks.


Go local

To have a holistic eco-friendly experience, you can opt for the local produce, try out local cuisines, explore local villages and mingle with the locals. ""On our trip to Sikkim, we bought produce from local farmers at a village and also tried the local cuisine in reusable dishes at our homestay,"" says Supriya.

She also indulged in plekking with some local schoolkids while on a high altitude trek in Sikkim. ""Plekking is similar to plogging – you pick up trash on your way while trekking. We were with a local guide who was very impressed with the idea. Some school kids also participated and we made some new friends!"" she shares."

However, it isn’t the same anymore. A growing number of female artistes are establishing their presence in it, and they are finding prominence too. According to Sushma Mairpady, a 25-year-old engineer, who recently performed in Bengaluru, Coastal Karnataka is abuzz with Yakshagana acts by women, and the trend is now spreading to other parts of the state as well.
“I started practising Yakshagana at the age of 10. I was inspired by my father. Those days, only men were seen taking the stage for the all-night dance-drama acts. But now, things are changing,” she says, adding, “It’s quite encouraging to see how so many female artistes are now pursuing this art form with zeal, particularly in Mangaluru, Udupi and Kundapura. Both working women and homemakers are taking time out of their daily routines to perform, even when the shows go on for long hours. And they are respected and supported by their families and society.”


Looking back at her 15-year journey in Yakshagana, Sushma says, “As a little girl, I used to practise almost every day at home. This went on until I finished college. There isn’t that kind of time now anymore. However, years of practice make you perfect the craft. As member of travelling troupes, now I can only manage to practise for a few days before the performance. There have also been instances of impromptu acts.”

Revisiting the epics through Yakshagana

Mostly based on stories of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, these Yakshagana performances are presented in two parts – ‘Teneku Tittu’ and ‘Badagu Tittu’. These comprise two prasangas – ‘Draupathi Prathapa’ and ‘Daksha Dwara’.

Another smart speaker user from Germany reported that more than 1,500 audio files were sent to a stranger and the information was sufficient to track the user and his girlfriend’s location.

After a fortnight, 20 coupons will be picked by lucky dip. The first 10 will receive a car worth Rs 5 lakh each, while the next 10 will win gold jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh each. Coupons will be given at all shows across Karnataka, and each ticket stands a chance to win.” Manju adds that this idea was the brainchild of producer Shivaprakash. “He took this as an opportunity to give back to people. In all, about a crore’s worth of prizes have been allocated for the public,” explains the filmmaker.

Sri Bharatha Baahubali is set to release in about 200 theatres. “The movie is a comedy thriller and is set against the backdrop of a village. Sarah Harish’s character comes to India to trace her early years here. How Chikkanna and I feature in this narrative and take the story forward, unfolds through the film,” sums up Manju."

"Created: Jan 17, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,-,"‘Playing Laila’s sister was such a fun, crazy experience’","There are many firsts in my life — though it’s such an oxymoron, it’s true. And somehow, all these ‘firsts’ are interrelated. I think my first-ever professional assignment was for a toy brand. I was very, very young then, and I don’t really remember how it came my way. And a few years later, I did an ad for an energy drink brand when I was in Class IV.
My mom’s friend, Krishna, is an ad filmmaker. He thought I was cute enough to do ads and asked my mom to get my portfolio done. There were no managers then and my photos were given to co-ordinators Rukmani aunty and Biju aunty. They would let us know whenever there was a requirement. So, that’s how this energy drink ad happened. On the day I had to shoot the ad, I also had internal assessment at school. My mom wouldn’t allow me to bunk and so, I quickly wrote the test and rushed home after telling my teacher that I had a tummy upset!


In my growing up years, I had anchored shows on a kids’ TV channel, and also shot for a short film for DD on pollution. It was like a mini-series, but I don’t think it took off. It was called The Birds Are Coughing, and it was shot by Priya ma’am. Little did I know then that she’d give me my first movie as well — Kanda Naal Mudhal. Somebody had seen my photos and told me that there was an audition happening for a film. When I went there, I was surprised to find out that it was being directed by Priya ma’am. We hadn’t met after the documentary and in the interim, she’d gone to work with Mani Ratnam sir as his assistant on films like Aayitha Ezhuthu (Yuva). So, when she met me, she was super excited and imagine my surprise when she said that she was searching for me all along! She had liked my work in the documentary, and wanted to work with me again. So, I auditioned for the role and before I even reached home, her team called to tell me that I was in and that I had to report to work in the next two days. I was just 14 then, in Class IX. Playing Laila’s sister was such a fun, crazy experience. I enjoyed acting; I enjoyed being different characters. I like expressing through art, and as I grew up, I understood how art has the ability to make people laugh, cry and experience so many other emotions. I am glad I chose to be an actor."

,"Updated: Jan 17, 2020, 16:38 IST",Lifestyle,5 must-learn commands,"Basic obedience is a must for all canine citizens. More so for pets in cities as they live in confined spaces, and interact with more humans.
DOG’S NAME
The first thing your puppy should learn is her/his name. It means that your pet must respond by looking at you when you call out her/his name. The easiest way to teach that is by offering a treat or praise (read good boy/girl), each time s/he looks at you, regardless of whether you call out your pet’s name or not. Your dog will soon learn that making eye contact is worth her/his while. Once s/he makes eye contact, add the name just prior to him/her making eye contact. Follow it either by a treat or praise. This way, your pet learns that the sound of her/his name, paired with eye contact, results in a treat or praise. Remember not to use her/his name while disciplining, especially when young.


COME The ‘Come’ command is one of the most important exercises you must teach your dog. A dog who moves reliably when called can be called out of life-threatening situations like running across roads while chasing another animal/ball... A dog that doesn’t come when called can also get lost if s/he manages to run off from the house or is loose from the leash during a walk.
Inside and outside the house, it is important to train your dog to have a reliable recall command. This command allows your dog to be called away from potentially dangerous situations.

STAY
A dog which can be trusted to stay in a particular spot can be a big help in situations where a door is left open, or a leash or collar breaks during a walk.

SIT
While walking on the street, it is a good idea to train your dog to ‘sit’, where a street and sidewalk meet. This way, you will avoid him/her trotting into the street when a vehicle is moving towards him.

DOWN
Pet parents can avoid dangerous situations by asking their dogs to get down when something dangerous approaches them. It gives them time to reach their dogs and save them.

Tips to motivate your pet

Choose the most valuable reward: The key is to find out what drives your dog a little crazy – it can be a toy, a praise, or a valuable treat. Once you know what works, it can be used to train her/him.
Train your dog at home first: It’s essential to find out whether your pet is comfortable in her environment. So, begin by having his training sessions at home, where he feels secure and safe to give you his undivided attention.
Keep distractions to a minimum: Train him in a place where there are not many distractions so that your intended reward should be the only one

"Updated: Jan 17, 2020, 19:17 IST",Unnati.joshi@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,More than a hobby: Shopping addiction can be a disorder,"Remember Rebecca Bloomwood from Confessions Of A Shopaholic? The girl was a mess and so was her closet, full of designer clothes that she bought and forgot, and many pairs of shoes that she didn't need. And it's not like she went on a shopping spree because she had loads of money to spare. She continued buying things even while being in some serious credit card debt. Rebecca was addicted to shopping and found it hard to say no to any item that caught her fancy, despite not being able to afford it. Experts say that Rebecca was a compulsive buyer. A person with Compulsive Buying Disorder (CBD) has an excessive preoccupation or poor impulse control with shopping, and studies have suggested that while it may help in relieving stress and tension in short term, in the long term, it can have adverse effects, which include financial stress, anxiety, negative emotions as well as discord with family and friends.
According to Delhi-based psychologist Dr Prerna Kohli, some people develop CBD as they essentially get addicted to how their brain feels while shopping. ""CBD is a type of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which isn't as common as other mental illnesses such as stress, anxiety or depression,"" she says, adding, ""While shopping the brain releases dopamine, also known as the 'feel-good' hormone. Dopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that's an important part of the brain's reward system. The pleasure and rush of dopamine is what a CBD patient is looking for.""

Don’t confuse love of shopping with addiction


It is important to note that love for shopping and going on occasional shopping sprees do not mean that one is a compulsive shopper and is suffering from some disorder. Experts say that when any kind of compulsion takes over and becomes an addiction, then it’s a problem. ""These days, people have easy access to shopping. Anyone who is giving in to that impulse, doesn’t necessarily have a disorder. Shopping is not a problem, but if you feel the compulsion to do it, then it’s a problem. If you are spending on things you don’t need and if you’re shopping even when you don’t have money, that’s a real problem,"" says Delhi-based psychologist Dr Harsheen K Arora.
Dr Kamna Chhibber, another psychologist from Delhi, adds, ""There's a big difference between having a penchant for shopping and having an outright
compulsion. People generally say that they are compulsive shoppers, they get these strong urges and they are not able to control it, but are they doing it at the cost of their lives, livelihood or relationships? If the answer is no, then it’s not necessarily CBD.""



'Men are compulsive shoppers, too'

Contrary to the popular belief, men can be compulsive shoppers, too. Dr Kamna Chhibber shares, ""I worked with this gentleman, who was in his late 30s. He used to engage in a lot of compulsive shopping. His mother had a similar habit. He told me that this habit had led to problems in his relationship with his wife. They had to consider selling their home as they were financially strained and had close to Rs 40 lakh to pay off. His wife didn’t trust him at all. So we had to work on all of that. Not just medication, we had to help him better his relationship with his wife as well.""


‘CBD exists in comorbidity’


Experts say that Compulsive Buying Disorder is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity. According to Dr Harsheen K Arora, “CBD is an addiction. There are no specific causes for this, it sometimes occurs on comorbidity. If a person has anxiety, depression or bipolar disorder, or any existing comorbid condition, this behaviour is co-existent with it. Low self-esteem can also be something that leads to this. For example, if you are feeling low, shopping may make you feel nice temporarily. It gives you a high, the excitement of new. And like any other addiction, the moment the high goes, you regret it,” she says."

The dignitaries present at the event were 15th Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, ‘Asia’s Strongest Man’ Manoj Chopra and Sandalwood actress Meghana Raj, who shared their life experiences as they answered questions put forth by the students of the college. Here are the highlights…
Meira Kumar, 15th Lok Sabha Speaker
Lessons from the past: I saw my father, Jagjivan Ram, smile during an intense situation, and I thought to myself: ‘this is courage’. So, by smiling when under pressure and keeping the composure is how I did it. I was very inspired by my father and aspired to follow his footsteps. I wanted to do the same thing, even if it was in a minuscule form. I have grown up on discrimination, and this is something that I have taken in my stride. I have faced discrimination on the basis of caste. In London, too, I faced discrimination when I was looking for a house. I’ve faced discrimination on the basis of my gender; every day, we had to prove ourselves. However, as a speaker, I was never discriminated on the basis of my caste or gender. But within myself, I had this strong resolve that I must do well. And if I didn’t, people wouldn’t discriminate Meira Kumar, but would discriminate me for being a woman.
Words of wisdom: Youngsters must take up politics and must remain dedicated to the ideology that they believe in. One must be able to differentiate between what’s right and wrong, and must stick by it. We must have the courage and we must educate ourselves, but always stand by the overwhelming majority of the downtrodden of this country.


Manoj Chopra, Asia’s Strongest Man Lessons from the past: After I failed at my travel business, I was very low. Although I was into physical exercise from a young age, I took this up after my business failed to take off. And that is when I came across the ‘World’s Strongest Man’ competition, and was surprised to see that there wasn’t anyone representing our country. I wanted to be that person and after a lot of hard work, I competed. All I ever wanted to do was represent my country and make my family proud.

Words of wisdom: I am six feet five inches tall, and weigh 175 kilograms. The question that I am asked often is about my diet. Well, it includes ‘see-food’, meaning the food that I see and I eat.


Meghana Raj, Actress

Lessons from the past: I always knew that I would become an actress. As a child, I would see my parents go to film sets and work hard. I wanted to do the same. It was not easy though. I was mocked for my weight and my skin. I used to have acne issues, and people would constantly comment on that. But I chose not to listen to anyone and gave it everything I had. I always thought that the path for me would be easy because my parents were from the industry, but that truth is that it is a challenge for everyone, irrespective of who your parents are. I thought I will do films one after another, but not many people realise that cinema is not a destination, it’s a journey. What matters is what happens after your first film. Even though my parents were from the industry, it was extremely difficult for me to establish myself.

Words of wisdom: My recent win at the State Film Awards gives me the confidence and courage to continue what I set out to do. Work hard and be the best. I have worked in four south Indian film industries, and, therefore, have made the effort to learn how to speak in all four languages. Individual efforts like these go a long way — in pursuing your passion, and achieving your dreams."
"Created: Jan 18, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,"My guru told me, be a gaaja when learning, a raaja on stage: Aruna Sairam","Apart from preparing for the Times Thyagaraja Awards, to be held today, the finalists also got an opportunity to meet and interact with eminent musician Aruna Sairam. The finalists — Pranathi Ganapuram, Samanvi, Kausthubh P Chandramouli, Srividya Vadlamani, Purva Dhanashree Cotah and Jayabhargavi — spoke to Aruna about their experience of participating in the competition, sharing the stage with accompanists, performing for a huge audience and the challenges they faced while singing within eight minutes (stipulated time).

As Aruna patiently listened to their journey so far, she also gave an interesting perspective to their time challenge. She said, “Winston Churchill once said that if he has to speak for an hour, he will do it right away. But if he is to speak for half-an-hour, he needs 15 days to prepare. And if it is going to be a five-minute speech, he will need a month’s time. You youngsters have 16 minutes for the final concert. Give it your best.”


Aruna also took time to explain to them what they should keep in mind when performing a classical concert. “Always keep in mind the three types of audiences who will come to your concerts. The pundits, who will know the in and out of classical music, the in-between crowd who will know some technical aspects, and lastly, the junta, who simply wants to enjoy a concert. So, think about what you want to do on stage so that you can cater to all the three types of rasikas. And no matter what, you will have to elicit feedback. People are generally polite and won’t say much. But if you get an opportunity, try and get an honest feedback from all of them. Once you can appeal to all the audiences, you will be an artiste who is loved by all,” she said.

Someone asked her about singing in a traditional manner to grab the attention of the rasikas, and Aruna said, “Say, for instance, you have a performance tomorrow. You will practice the song a million times. But as you keep singing it multiple times, there will be a point where the technical predomination in your mind will recede. You will naturally enjoy and sing from your heart. My guru, Brinda ma, is a traditionalist. She has an image of being very strict. But when I was 10 years old, she told me when I am learning music, I should be a gaaja and when I get on stage, I should be a raaja. Perfection is a constant journey; but singing with confidence is what impresses the rasikas the most. You can always strive to attain the perfect, but don’t miss out on exuding confidence on stage.”

"Created: Jan 18, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,Chennai is my temple and my second home: Sukhwinder Singh,"Chennai will always remain special for Sukhwinder Singh. The city, after all, is what gave the dynamic singer Chaiyya Chaiyya, a crackling sensation he recorded with AR Rahman in 1998. Over 20 years since then, Sukhwinder, who was in the city for a Sufi performance recently, called Chennai his city of dreams. “This is the city that connected me and my music to the entire world,” he recalled, as we sat down for a chat to discuss the emerging trends in music, the remix culture and the #MeToo movement. Excerpts:
You began your journey with Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se, which you recorded in Chennai. What does this city mean to you?
This is the place where I met Rahman in the late 1990s. This is the city that connected me and my music to the entire world. This is not just a city for me. This is my temple and my second home. I often come here for film recordings. I have come to Chennai this time for a special reason. I have come here to perform for a special occasion at Rahman’s guru, Malik’s ashram in Kadapa. I would be singing a Sufi-style song.

Coming back to your recording session for Chaiyya Chaiyya, did you expect the song to be such a huge hit?
I knew that I had met a legend when I met Rahman. But when I got to know that he prefers working in the night, I began crying (laughs). But that is his style and legends have such styles. And I didn’t have any expectations from the song because all I did was record a beautiful song with Rahman. We didn’t even think about the response.
What was his brief to you about the song?
He told me about the composition and asked me to complement it through my voice. He also told me that I was welcome to improvise it whenever I wanted. He told me, “Sukhi, enjoy”. He is the best person to have happened to the country.

You have been in the industry for years now. How do you think the industry has changed over the years when you look back today?
I adapt myself to the present trends. The past, of course, brims with memorable experiences. But I am a man who lives in the present. The changes are all technical. There is more equipment today and we have become more scientifically attuned. Even in the 2000s, when I met Rahman, he worked with the best of keyboards and mixers. While everything was electronic, the sur was natural. His way of working was very natural, acoustic and pious.

Good technique enhances the sur of the song, giving it a clean sound. That is very important. But when you depend completely on technology, it only means you do not have the capability. People who are blessed with music do use technology, but they aren’t completely dependent on it.

Just last month, a film’s team approached me to record a song with just my voice — with no orchestra or symphony. I was very impressed with it and went ahead to record it. It is for a film, which will be unveiled soon. I do realise that not every song can be like this. But I make it a point to upgrade myself with the changing times.

What is your take on the remix culture today?
People get angry about remixes, but I love to do it because I see it as a form of creativity. When the passion is the same, it is alright. There are so many remixes that sound wrong, but there are many that sound original, too. I appreciate such efforts.
I am absolutely OK with being part of remixes, as long as it is for a special reason. I will not do it just for the sake of it. I have done only one remix till now. But people want hundreds more. But I will approach it in a slow and steady fashion.

Most people still identify the tonality of seasoned singers like you just by hearing their voice. Do you think that’s a quality that we don’t see any more with the emergence of auto-tune?
If songs and singers of the past have that charm in the voice, it is because of the winning combination of the composer and the singer. I always give the credit to the music director.

Coming to the auto-tuning part, I cannot fault people who go for this practice, because at the end of the day, singers are trying their level best to become popular. They know very well that they might not be exceptional. You cannot find a Beethovan or Rahman or SPB everywhere. There are dedicated, devoted singers, but they are very less.


Do you think music today is more about beautifully packaged videos and less about music itself?
You can find good-looking people in the music industry. There are many personalities in the West, who are extremely good-looking and present themselves with gravitas. There are many Hollywood star singers. But they do have talent. They practice a lot. Singers like Celine Dion and Whitney Houston are known for their electric performances. Many teenagers want to copy Britney Spears or Shakira. Style is necessary, but not at the cost of talent, which is supreme.


Let us speak about the #MeToo movement, which has impacted the music industry as well. Do you think there have been any consequences since then?
There were a few people who realised that their cheap actions cannot be repeated again. There are many actors, filmmakers, composers who conduct themselves very well. But there are going to be exceptions. I think things are changing slowly and people have understood that this kind of behaviour is definitely not OK."

He admits that it is tougher for senior actors to find meaty roles in television. He tells BT, “Films are open to senior actors playing a prominent part, but on TV, it gets increasingly difficult as you become older.” The actor adds, “After you have worked in the industry for more than a decade, it’s not easy to switch careers. So, most actors continue to take up similar roles for the sake of earning a livelihood. Therefore, it’s important for every actor to contemplate from time to time whether he would want to continue doing the same thing, or have an alternative career on the side.”

Himanshu also feels that television serials should now go the finite way. He shares, “Personally, I would want 26-episode finite series where the producers, broadcasters, cast and crew do not have the unnecessary pressure of ratings and delivery of episodes. An actor should be leaving the set with a sense of fulfilment, unlike today, when most people come to a set just because their survival depends on the job.”

Meanwhile, on the work front, Himanshu will be seen playing a doctor in a show titled 'Dil Jo Dhadke, Dhadakne Do'."

This city has a certain vibe to it that draws many. To perform in front of such lively and responsive audiences is a dream for many aspiring artistes,” says TT Sriram, the frontman of Chennai-based band, Skrat, that recently performed at a city music festival. Commenting on the recent scenario in Bengaluru that saw a number of popular venues closing down, he says, “While the local residents complaining about loud music in the neighbourhood might have a point, the fact that the closure has disrupted the indie and live music scene in the city cannot be denied. We should be able to strike a balance between the two things. Soundproofing the venues could help to a certain extent. Finding a solution to the problem rather than having an ongoing conflict on the matter would probably be a better option.”

Cut to performing different genres together, particularly Rock ‘n’ Roll and indie rock, the artiste says, “Making music that doesn’t fall into any particular genre is quite risky. For instance, Rock ‘n’ Roll and indie rock together don’t have a rapid growth curve. And so, they seem to be ‘outdated’ for many listeners. As today’s musicians, our goal is to attract more and more audiences — making them groove to our original songs.”"

The actress, we hear, has been signed up for Kannadathi, which has Kiran Raj and Ranjani Raghavan in the lead. “While I would have loved to start my small screen tryst with a Kannada serial, the opportunity first came from Tamil. I am glad that I have been offered a role in Kannadathi; better late than never, right?” she says.

In Kannadathi, Sarah will play Varudhini, a wedding planner who hails from an affluent family. “Interestingly, my character also has a negative shade, which will be revealed later on in the narrative. Varudhini is a straightforward girl, who comes across as rather rude, but manages to justify her behaviour. The extent to which she goes about planning things to make sure she gets what she wants will intrigue viewers,” says the actress, who adds that she is set to sign up for another Kannada film as well and that she is looking at balancing careers on the big and small screen."

In fact, every plant lover will confess to this. Beginners too are often enamoured by the charm of a nursery and can end up buying plants that they either don't know how to care for or didn't plan on buying. Here are a few tips to keep in mind while you are on your next plant shopping spree...

Begin with plants that are low maintenance: If you are just starting to build your garden at home, start with plants that are difficult to kill. Varieties of snake plant, jade, ZZ, money plant, pleomele, dianthus, syngonium and others are some that do not require excess attention.


Before purchasing, compare the prices: If you spot an extraordinary succulent and cannot wait to bring it home, ask at a few nurseries around and compare the prices.

Enquire about watering, sunlight and other requirements of the plants: Once you have decided on the plants to pick, ask about how much water and sunlight it needs. However, once you take the plant home, you will be the best judge to see how much sun and water it needs.


Envision where you will place the plants and buy accordingly: Before buying plants, decide where you want to place them at home. You do not want to end up with really big plants with no place to show them off, do you?"

And, given that the story is set in an earlier era, the team has gone out of its way to try and recreate it with elaborate sets, etc. “The story is set in the period from 1947 all the way till the 70s. It is a period film. So, the sets play a very important role in the narration of this story. Not just the ambience and props, the team has sketched out details like lighting and effects to ensure the visuals are as good as real. The film is being shot on a big scale and the makers are set to bring in visual grandeur to our screens. Shooting for Kabza is going to take us a year. In that way, it is going to be one among my most challenging roles — it requires focus on perfection for each shot, and waiting to get a detailed set in place for every aspect of the narration,” says Upendra, adding that Kabza will be released in seven languages — including Bengali and Marathi."

As we entered actor Smruthi Venkat’s house to meet her pet Beagle Rowdy, the dog gave us a warm or rather a loving welcome into his home. It took him a good 15 minutes to shower us with unconditional love. Once he was used to us being around, we settled down to speak to Smruthi about her darling pet and her son, Rowdy. Excerpts:
‘He is a friendly dog’
Smruthi says that she always wanted to have a pet dog. “My parents were against the idea. It is not that they didn’t like dogs, but it is a big responsibility. I have always liked dogs, though. I like big dogs, like German Shepherd and Indie breeds. But you can’t have them in an apartment. I finally decided to have a Beagle. Actually, a friend and I bought him together. I didn’t know much about this breed, and began researching about Beagle only after I bought him home. Initially, I was very scared as I didn’t know how to parent him. He used to play all night long and wouldn’t get used to the time pattern. It would took me a long time to put him to sleep in the nights and play during the day. But now, he wakes up only after I do. He doesn’t sleep on the floor and sleeps near my foot or head. He wants the bed to himself,” smiles Smruthi.


The actor says that all Rowdy wants is attention. She says, “He wants to be pampered all the time. That’s the only thing he asks of you. He is a friendly dog and welcomes every one with his charm and love. After he came home, my parents, too, love and adore him. In fact, there have been moments when I learnt that they love him more than I do. My mother plays with him every morning before she leaves to work.”

‘I never felt this loved before’
Smruthi says that her life has changed so much since Rowdy came. “I never felt this loved before. In whatever frame of mind I am in, my mood instantly gets better when I see him. He never lets me lose my cool. The way he reacts when I am upset or angry makes me feel sad. And that instantly changes my mood. There was a time when my friend and I had a huge argument. He sat in between and was literally trying to control our anger. It just took a moment for us to realise that it was Rowdy who was making peace between us. One another time, he couldn’t stop barking when he heard my friend’s kid cry. He stopped only after the baby stopped. He loves kids and goes crazy when he sees them.”



Smruthi also says that there is so much to learn from a pet. “I have never seen him angry or upset. I learned to give back love because of him. I let go half of my arguments, too. They teach you patience. And yes, I used to have a messy room. Now, I keep it clean as he picks up whatever he finds on the floor and chews on them. I also ensure that everything at home is pet-friendly, including the floor cleaning liquid and tissues that we use. I have become more responsible because of Rowdy.”

‘He thinks he’s human’
Smruthi says that she’s tried doing play dates for Rowdy. “Most of my friends have dogs. I took him to a friend’s place and she has a Labrador. Rowdy wasn’t too kicked about the idea and didn’t really play with him. He thinks he’s human. Over time, he got friendly,” says Smruthi.




The actor also revealed that he’d developed an eye problem and was operated recently. “He had cherry eye, where the tear gland pops out. He had to be in a certain weight to be operated. We got it done recently. Now, I am really kicked about taking him to the beach,” says Smruthi. Rowdy recently turned one and Smruthi hosted a dog party along with her friends and their furry children.


Smruthi says that her dream is to have an independent house and have plenty of dogs. “I have given myself three years to invest in an independent house. Like I mentioned before, I love Indie dogs. I want to buy an independent house so that dogs can move around peacefully.”"

In fact, they have been tight-lipped about their big day, as they don’t want any undue attention. They are currently busy with last-minute preparations for their big day. A reception will be hosted in Mumbai later, but the date is yet to be finalised.”


Simran and Gurickk first met five years ago and fell in love, eventually. They got engaged a few months ago. Adds the source, “Theirs is quite a cute love story. They first met at a race in which Gurickk was one of the participants. However, he crashed in the first lap. He then went up to Simran and told her that he couldn’t concentrate on the race because of her, and asked her out. Simran found it cheesy, but gave in to his boyish charm and the rest is history. They are extremely compatible and comfortable with each other.”

Both Simran and Gurickk remained unavailable for comment."

"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,What’s wakei-seijyaku?,"Tranquillity is going to be the biggest wellness term of 2020. All over the world, people are trying to find joy in a single moment of peace and calm. Experts say it’s the first step towards finding tranquillity in the longer run. The Japanese call this wakei-seijyaku – a crafted tranquil moment. It could be that moment when you light a candle and get into bed at the end of the day. It can be the sound of birds chirping as you step out of your house in the morning, or, it could be those moments you create for yourself during the day to calm yourself – like making a cup of tea, silencing your mind for a minute, listening to your favourite song...
Author Mari Fujimoto describes wakei-seijyaku as “the sum of its four individual characters: harmony (wa), respect (kei), purity (sei) and tranquillity (jyaku)”. He says, “Wakei-seijyaku is about taking the time, and care to care for a moment of inner calm. To live by wakei-seijyaku is to linger. To notice. To be present. The traditional tea
ceremony of Japan best exemplifies how this quiet, attentive peace might be achieved.”


Finding personal harmony The idea is to do things in order to find moments of harmony – from the gap between breathing in and breathing out, to that second you find yourself alone on a the train platform... As you go about your day, keep these wakei-seijyaku moments in mind, and you’ll be in harmony and peace wherever you go.

Go to your sacred spaces
Be a silent observer. Sit in a cafe. That can be your wakei-seijyaku. Read a book. Observe others; you can actually learn a lot about yourself just by observing things and people around you. If you want to further disconnect yourself from the mad rush, go and sit on the grass at the edge of a river or a lake close by. To be near a body of water brings about serenity and helps you think more clearly.

Says Monisha Doley, confidence coach and author of Get a High on Spirit, “Find tranquillity in moments whenever your heart feels easy. Just allow yourself to be present. Look for tranquillity to overtake your mind
and spirit. Feel at peace.”

Vibrational healing
To pursue a calmer life, energy healing encompasses several different types of healing practices – from Reiki and chakra clearing to acupuncture, the list goes on. Though each is different, the essence of each treatment is the same – they are trying to restore balance to the body. The body is made up of seven chakras or centres – each responsible for a different source of energy.

Try some vibrational therapy with vibrations from the earth and sounds from specific objects to help
restore peace within the body. All this will elevate your sense of wakei-seijyaku and help your body reach an optimum level of wellness.

How can we find harmony?

TEDx speaker Shruti Chatur Lal Sharma said during her talk on Euphonic Yoga (yoga combined with music and dance), that this form of yoga helps people discover tranquil moments in life. It has cultural nuances, and helps you create an atmosphere, where you can reconnect with your inner self – through stotra (hymn), beej mantras, breathing exercises, asanas, therapeutic mudras etc.


“This step towards tranquillity includes guidelines mentioned in our ancient texts that are still relevant.

It shows you a path that leads to a calm and serene life. It’s a healing and uplifting cycle, where practitioners sing, dance, perform yogic postures and feel each other’s vibes to find balance,” she says.


Wakei-seijyaku is about taking the time, and care to care for a moment of inner calm. To live by wakei-seijyaku is to linger. To notice. To be present."
"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Hansy Sanctis,Entertainment,Bengaluru is the rock capital of India: Antariksh,"Led by vocalist Varun Rajput, Hindi rock band Antariksh experiments with musical genres like rock, pop, reggae, Carnatic classical and funk music. The band also features Joshua Peter (vocals and keyboards), Shrikant Biswakarma (guitars and vocals) and Dan Thomas (drums). Talking to us at a recent college festival, where the band performed, Varun says, “Bengaluru is definitely the rock capital of India. When we started performing, I remember how every musician or band would perform here to see how well their music is received by audiences. The city’s response to new music is genuine, unbiased and comes straight from the heart. People here have good taste in music and enjoy listening to various genres as well. If the audience in Bengaluru doesn’t like your music, it’s a definite no in other cities as well.”

That’s not the only reason Varun likes the city. “Bengaluru has excellent weather when compared to Delhi. We hit the roads to try dosa and chai when we arrived in the city. One can have a hearty South Indian breakfast here for just 40 bucks! That’s quite a steal. Bengalureans are also warm, gentle and courteous. There are many good rock bands in the city, like Thermal and a Quarter for instance. That’s why we’re always keen to visit the city,” he says.


Varun further says that Antariksh aspires to make a bigger name in the Indie rock community. “We are very lucky, as our debut album Khoj and one of our singles from the second album, Kaaha Re, were appreciated by our fans and by many people from the music industry. We are planning to release our second album by the end of October. We hope to get an even better response,” he sums up."

,"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Lifestyle,High heels 101,"How high is comfortable?


Figure out the height of the heel you can get by in without toppling over or being in pain. Heels are considered empowering; falling on your face wearing one is not really the effect you are aiming for. To figure out your heel height, try on a pair with 3-inch heel and work your way up. You can borrow from a friend or family member.
Shoe size matters
Whenever you wear heels, know that your feet will be pushed forward. So it’s important you try

your heel out for the right size. It’s prudent to pick a size bigger than what you wear to avoid pinching.


Pick your style
Try different styles from open to closed-toe shoes. While pumps are a good everyday pick, you don’t want a shoe that forces your toes together. Some feet are not shaped to be fitted in tapered styles and wincing in pain is not a good look.

Always do a stand test
High heel shoes can make your legs look fetching but before you try on the heel for size, it’s important to stand up in them. Experts advise breaking in your heels by wearing them for about 10-15 minutes a day, couple of times.


Start walking
Just like the stand test, practice walking. Walking in heels is a major adjustment – for your feet and entire body. Attempt to walk in them for about 20 minutes a day. Take small steps, not long strides."
"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Will it be Santhanam versus Santhanam on January 31?,"It is common practice in the film industry to ensure that two films of the same actor don’t release on the same day as it would split the business and affect their box office collections. But now, the makers of Dagalty and Server Sundaram, both of which star Santhanam, have announced that their films will be releasing on the same date January 31.
We spoke to the producers of the two films and both say that while this has been a surprise to them as well, they are hoping that things will get sorted.

“We have been working towards this release date since December, coming out with the first and second singles, the teaser and so on. But it was only after we had announced our release date that the Server Sundaram team has announced theirs,” says SP Chowdhary, producer of Dagalty. He admits that the other film’s team did call and check with him on when he was planning on releasing his film. “I’d told them we were looking at January 31. So, it was a shock when they came out with the announcement that they would also be releasing on the same day. And since then, they haven’t gotten in touch with us,” he says.
Meanwhile, J Selvakumar, the producer of Server Sundaram, has a different story to tell. “Our film was ready two years ago, and we have got it censored first. We were waiting for the right time to release it because we had a lot of issues that had to be sorted out. We were just coming out of that mess and thought we should release the film when things were looking good. So, we had informed the various players that we were hoping to release on this date. I’m not sure why the makers of Dagalty also want to release their film on this date, despite us having passed on the information about our film’s release to them,” he says.


But the two producers remain confident that their films will do well even if they release on the same date. “I’m depressed because this is my first film, and I’m facing such a situation. I feel that if I back out after announcing the release date, it might affect my equation with the trade in the future. But I don’t have any problem if that film also releases on the same day. It could even be a double treat for Santhanam sir’s fans,” he says and adds that he has so far managed to confirm 350+ screens.


“As far as we are concerned, this movie has a different content — a food-based commercial film. Santhanam sir had helped us get this title from the AVM family. The title itself has a value. And Santhanam sir is playing a chef. So, we are confident on our content. Also, ever since we announced the release date, we have been getting great response. The person who has bought our film is also confident that they can release the film on their own on this date. They have assured us that they will get the film to theatres,” says Selvakumar.


Chowdhary says that he hasn’t spoken about this issue with Santhanam because it would be wrong of him to ask the actor to mediate. “I cannot ask him to support my film and not back the other one because both are his films,” he says. Meanwhile, Selvakumar says he is waiting to meet Santhanam and discuss this issue with him. “We couldn’t reach him; we were told he is out of station for a meditation programme,” he informs.


However, Selvakumar has requested the Tamil Film Producers Council to help out. “The council actually helped us sort out our previous issues, so I’m looking to them for guidance. I hope we will get a better clarity in the coming week — since the Pongal holidays are now over,” he says, and adds that he isn’t averse to requesting the Dagalty team to reconsider their decision. “Since we are coming out of a struggle, both myself and my director have already requested their help. The struggle that we have been through in the past two years cannot be described in words. So, we want everyone’s help,” he says."

This mechanism causes the brain to pull away from the skull, causing pain and resulting in a ‘dehydration headache’.

Poor concentration: As the human mind holds around 90% water, it certainly gives hints when it is dried out. The absence of it in the mind can influence your mood and memory.


Dry mouth and bad breath: The absence of water creates less spit in the mouth, which contains antibacterial properties. This leads to more bacteria in the mouth, bringing about bad breath.

Food cravings: Whenever you have sudden cravings, drink a glass of water before eating something. Your body often sends false flags that you are hungry, when you are actually thirsty.


Lethargy and fatigue: When you are feeling lethargic and exhausted, it can be because of dehydration. The absence of water causes low circulatory strain and insufficient oxygen supply all through the body. The absence of oxygen causes lethargy and a lazy feeling."
"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nupur Amarnath,Lifestyle,Should you try skin fasting?,"The field of skincare is probably one of the most vibrant areas of research currently. From organic to natural to new compounds, modern-day skincare is an evolved science that has something for even the tiniest epidermal evils. Just like nutritionally, fasting has emerged as the detox tour de force – it was only a matter of time before the concept crept in to skincare. People started talking about skin fasting in 2019. Skin fasting is a period of time when you give your skin a breather from any products – but different experts have different interpretations. Celebrity dermatologist Dr Shefali Trasi Nerurkar suggests taking a break from any chemicals in the form of moisturisers, cleansers, toners, night creams and of course, make-up for a day. Dermatologist and aesthetic physician Dr Pallavi Sule advises doing away with application of one of the skincare products (her pick is a night cream) for one or two nights. Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr Soma Sarkar, however, debunks detox completely as it doesn’t hold any science behind it. “The skin needs a detox if the products you are using are not right or causing an issue like irritation,” she says. Yet skin fasting is a bonafide trend.

FAST AND FURIOUS
Experts can see some merit in giving the skin a breather from products. Trasi says, “In this era, we are at times overdoing or over treating the skin. Every once in a while skin has the right to breathe without any cream or cleanser or toner. This may improve the skin quality.” Sule mentions how going off one product for a day or two can help the skin recover from the weakened process of production of natural oils. She adds, “It can work as a way to detox but the skin does not need detox from ‘all’ products. Different skin types have different skincare needs. For instance, dry skin will need a moisturiser. Plus skin changes its needs according to seasons.” A good way to ease in to this fasting routine is to do away with products that do not suit you that season.

The concept was started by Koko Hayashi, founder of a US beauty brand Mirai Clinical that aims to bring in Japanese ideas of beauty to the western world. He claims that the Japanese have studied the skin’s regeneration on a monthly basis and proved that ‘skin fasting’ improves your skin’s condition and detoxify skin impurities. Even though Hayashi’s claims don’t find any scientific backing, many are ready to give it a whirl.
Sule suggests seeking advice from your dermatologist to know the right course for you. “If one is not following a good regime or we observe any overuse of products, go off that product, not the routine,” she cautions. Sarkar suggests taking a break from routine make-up once in a while but not skincare. She says, “What you can do is to not overdo skincare regime – keep it simple yet significant.”
What is it? A new-age technique where a person avoids every kind of skincare product like lotion, toner, and serum. Skin produces a natural oil called sebum for countering moisture loss and products hinder it from doing its work. It allows your skin to “breathe”
How do you do it? Stop using products for a certain duration and once your skin returns to its natural state, slowly re-introduce them
What are the benefits? It apparently strengthens your skin and helps it develop its own fighting mechanism

Cautions? If you have a skin condition or use medicated products, ask your physician first. You will experience dry or oily patches at first


GOOD TO KNOW
- Duration depends on skin type and season like spring (not too hot or cold) l Ideal time is once in 1-2 months. Or even one day in a week

- Go off all or some products depending on your skin type

- Drink lots of water, fresh juices and don’t step out in the sun

-If you have dry skin, try partial skin fasting and use coconut oil l If you have oily skin, use a towel and not a cleanser

"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,How we socialise in 2020,"We don’t socialise over dinner parties anymore. Our friends aren’t just the ones we meet now and then over laidback dinner parties or quick coffee breaks. That happened in 2002. In 2020, there is no barrier in age or gender when it comes to friendships. A 25-something is best friend to a 55-something because they can relate to the same things. The world we live in has become far more unstructured and fluid, thanks to digital revolution.
The 2020 principle of socialising is all about diluting yourself in a group for a greater impact. Young professionals are flocking to these playgrounds because ‘raising the self’ is the zeitgeist of our times. Our meetings or purpose of meeting people ismore intense in nature and unstructured in form – mostly because this is a Seeker’s Generation.

Strong hashtag bonds
Since the world became a global village, we started to find things far more common with a complete stranger than an old friend. Whether through Insta hashtags or FB hobby groups, people eventually started to form new friendships. This is a paradigm shift from the times when people used to meet old friends annually in an alumni group or once in a while. Says author and life coach Anand Chulani, “Far more people these days have started out in new cities and alien cultures because age isn’t a factor to decide where or how we want to live anymore. The best way to bond in such a scenario is to make new friends through joining a community. It doesn’t matter anymore whether you like to dance or cook, if you come together, you form new habits and friendships to last a lifetime.” Page 3 parties, once the toast of town, are now almost embarrassing to be spotted at, let alone being photographed for posterity. These days, people prefer going rock-climbing with friends, meet like-minded health freaks on a four-hour marathon or a yoga studio, or socialise on a food/heritage/culture walk.

Seeker’s Generation
Gurpreet Wasi, founder of SuperSikh Run, says, “The socialising in my running group comes more naturally... the conversations are easy. It’s less about training, more about bonding, a fun way to interact with like-minded people. We don’t network, that’s very last decade. We are like a community which cares about our own spiritual growth by learning from one another.”

The need for ‘engaged socialisation’ is emerging as the biggest way people bond in 2020. If you look at last year, people on a large scale came together all over the world — whether it was the Hong Kong democracy protests, the climate extinction march or the students’ march in India — to fight for common causes. The way we interact with one another is fundamentally changing. But this feeling wasn’t born in a day.

Professor Antarpreet Singh, expert of digital learning, ISB, puts it simply when he says, digital platforms with a social setting have provided an excellent environment for people to bond, share views, have fun, cultivate new relationships and learn from each other. “We are witnessing the rise of ‘communities of interest’ – these are groups of people with common interests and a very strong motivation to learn from one another through interactions within a community framework,” he says.

Soul bonding
According to researchers this kind of ‘soul bonding’ is the way people live longer – much like the Japanese concept Moai (meeting for a common purpose), a term that originated from social support groups in Okinawa, Japan. They follow the Buddhist idea of ‘itai doshin’, which means “many in body, one in mind”. People, from every age, have learnt, that it is essential to start building your Moai. It can be done through running, food, heritage walks, travelling groups, dance classes…

raising the self
Chulani says this urge to raise the self is a result of all of us turning into “human doings” rather than being “human beings” over the last few decades. “Driven by corporate goals, we became activity managers obsessed with being busy. Most people used to find it difficult to be present in the moment. Community socialising is actually people’s way of rebelling against that old culture,” she says.

These hobby groups are a good thing because they force people to come together physically to connect and spend time with each other. Reading a book alone is fulfilling, but being able to go to a book club and sharing ideas with people can make the experience even richer.

Says Navina Jafa, a Delhi-based historian who conducts heritage walks in the city, “There’s more depth in interacting and socialising in small groups. In any culture walk, people come together to create collective memories, which eventually turn into beautiful friendships.” This is how we socialise in 2020; by creating new forms of intimacy.

— Gurpreet Wasi, founder of SuperSikh Run


A famous study, by psychologist William Fleeson and his colleagues, trying to answer what really makes us smile spontaneously found that talking with people face to face — even if they were introverts — brought out positive emotions: excitement, enthusiasm. Everyone feels happier when they socialise, said the study."

The actor, who is currently shooting for Basil Joseph’s superhero film Minnal Murali in Wayanad, has been getting in shape for the role doing a mix of cardio, core and strength routines and high intensity interval training along with CrossFit. And it is clear, even as we catch up with him at 10.30 pm after a gym session, is that he is willing to go the whole nine yards for his characters with a no-excuse approach. Excerpts from the conversation:
What can we expect from the superhero film, Minnal Murali?

It’s a comedy (laughs). Even if you take out the superhero elements in the movie, I can assure you it will still be an enjoyable film. Like Basil’s previous films Kunjiramayanam and Godha, the story is set in a fictional village and that’s where its hero Jason is struck by a lightning and gets his super powers.


With Hollywood superhero movies having a massive fanbase here, do you think it has now become easier to pull off a superhero movie in Malayalam?

We have had fantasy movies like Njan Gandharvan, O' Faby, Athisayan and Sakshal Sreeman Chathunni that have worked. In this film too, we have tried to present the fantasy element convincingly. If you search online, you would find several instances of those struck by a lightning, experiencing differences in their lives like being able to make a bulb glow for a second or their watches stopping. So, when high voltage courses through the body its dynamics change somewhat. In that way, it’s also a realistic movie.

Are you now in a position where you can pick and choose your roles?

That’s what I have been doing for a while now. Take my next release, Kilometres and Kilometres. I play an ordinary Kottayam guy named Josemon who has to look after his family. He has studied only till Class 10 and his intellect is limited. But in Forensic, I am playing a medico-legal advisor. So, his thoughts and way of approaching things are more refined. It’s also the first time I am doing a crime thriller. Minnal Murali is set in the 90s and my character is sort of a freaken, so there are different possibilities on how I can interpret the role. Meanwhile, Muhsin Perari’s Thallumala is set in Malabar and the story spans from a guy’s college years to mid 30s and in Jude Anthany Joseph’s 2403ft, I play an ex-soldier who ran away from the military. In Ajayante Randam Moshanam, I will have to put in the effort of doing three movies to play the triple role so I can convince the audience that all three are not the same person. So, the roles I am getting to play are all exciting and something that I haven’t done before. It’s very much in line with my criteria of not repeating myself.

You are someone who enjoys travelling in real life, so you must have had a blast while doing Kilometres and Kilometres.


The film’s plot takes a turn when a foreigner enters the life of Josemon and he travels with her from Kerala to Khardung La on a bike, via Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Daman and Diu, Gujarat and Ladakh. We have tried to avoid the cities and focused on the interiors of the country. Everyone involved in the movie have been asking when are we doing its sequel? The entire cast and crew travelled on a bus, which we had used to sleep, store our costumes, art props as well as the bike and a dismantled rickshaw.

If we had shot it the same way we usually do, it would go over budget. But for this film, everybody stood united to make it work; we ate, stayed and travelled together. In some places like Goa, we only shot in the morning and people were free to go anywhere after the shoot, provided they were back for the next day’s shoot. So, it was like going on a tour and the shooting was just part of it.



How did the film’s lead actress India Jarvis, who is from the US, adjust to the working style?


She and her boyfriend Eden are artistes. They threw no tantrums and were in sync with us. I think people from outside the country understand us better. Even for them, it was a unique experience. While we were travelling, we encountered several varied climatic conditions. It was freezing in Ladakh, scorching in Rajasthan and raining heavily in other places.

Our diversity is what makes India stand apart. Every 400km, our culture, food habits, dressing styles and languages change. You can’t see this diversity anywhere in the world. We have tried to include all this in the movie.

Last year, there was hardly a month where you didn’t have a release. But this year with you signing big projects, does it warrant you to put in more time and effort?


I don’t completely agree with that. You can say that I had a release a month, if I was playing the lead role in all the films. But I did movies like Lucifer, Virus and Uyare. For me, every project is important. My job is to perform and promote the movies well. I do my homework for each role well and then go by what the director demands of me. Last year, I have done some good films like Luca and Kalki, which I still believe deserved a better run at the box office if not for certain circumstances. I also won an international award for And The Oscar Goes To…, so my conscience is clear. I give my full commitment when I am doing a film, despite the length of my role. In the past month, I haven’t gone home for my daughter’s birthday or for Christmas because I was busy with shoot.



You have been working a lot with debutant directors. But now that you have become a star, do you think twice before signing up projects with newcomers?

When you are working with established directors, you know what they are capable of and you can rely on them. But in the case of newcomers, you must blindly trust them. There’s nothing else you can do. When they come to me with their scripts and tell me they can confidently pull it off, I trust them. I can’t tell them to come to me after gaining more experience. If they must get experience, somebody will have to work with them. I’m here because people put their faith in me when I was starting out. So, I am aware of that and try to balance that while choosing the projects.


You are one of the few celebrities who have always shared his stand on issues.


I have always tried to react when it comes to political issues. Considering the ongoing protests, it’s not just me but a lot of people in the industry who have expressed their solidarity because it’s the need of a generation. However, I am not against those who are not taking a stand. Maybe that’s what they are used to and I am fine with that. Everyone cannot react to a particular issue the same way; we aren’t all robots. Everyone has their own ideologies. They have the freedom to do that and that’s what we are fighting for."
"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,The return of repair,"Picture this: there’s a broken china cup in your kitchen. Would you try to repair it? Or maybe there’s a shawl with a hole. Do you throw it away or take it to a rafugar? It could be a copper utensil turned black. Would you go to a qaliywallah (polishers) to make it look brand new? If the answer to all of the above is yes, then you are a part of the quiet movement against ‘throwaway culture’ in home décor. Terms like repair, improvise, recycle, upcycle and mend are coming in to interior design. Homeowners are following the ‘buy me once’ motto to get products that last a lifetime – from cookware to hair brushes to toys.
The power of mending
Francisco Martínez, an ethnographer at University of Helsinki, in his research found repair was “helping people overcome the negative logic that accompanies the abandonment of things and people”. Repair made “late modern societies more balanced, kind and stronger”. It was a form of care, of healing wounds, binding generations together. Martínez feels that repairing things establishes continuity, endurance and material sensitivity. He writes in his research: “Contemporary mending and the reluctance to dispose off material possessions can also be a way to resist dispossession and adapt to convoluted changes; the act of throwing away is perceived as a threat to memory, to security, and historical and ecological preservation.”

Upcycle teacups as planters

Cloth scraps woven as baskets
British anthropologist Daniel Miller observed residents who fixed their kitchens. Those with strong and fulfilling social relationships were more likely to do so than those with shallow relationships. Architect Rishabh Sarpal says, “We are witnessing homes where people want structures of modernity that last a lifetime. From doors to furniture people seek designs that are forever. They don’t want to change their homes every other year. It’s considered uncaring and with no attachment.” Here’s all you can do to get in to the mending mindset…

A stitch in time rafugars
SCRAP IT: A lot of brands are stitching together clothing scraps or even upcycling materials to create new looks

Rafugari is an age-old practice where craftsmen repair antique shawls and clothes with tender love and attention. Rafugars study antique patterns closely to repair clothes. They match the thread and finish the product in a way that it is hard to find any traces of repair. Rafugari needs patience and a clean hand to make the end product look neat. Most rafugars take out threads from the same piece of cloth which needs repairing. A trained rafugar also embellishes design when necessary to make parts of a piece look more eye-catching.

Meet and mend repair cafes

Repair cafés are free meeting places where people meet to mend. It’s all about repairing things together. Such places are kitted out with tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need – on clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, toys, etc. You’ll also find expert volunteers to assist you with some technical knowhow. The idea is to bring broken items from home and mend it together with the specialists. If you have nothing to repair, you can enjoy a cup of tea or coffee or help someone else with a repair job. A repair café in Bengaluru is reviving the dying skill of repairing things. Started by Antara Mukherji and Purna Sarkar, the idea is that repair economies don’t regard material things as expendable. The duo organise workshops, DIY classes and work tirelessly to relocate value in the working, relation and meaning of things.


Mend-ful enjoyment

Repair parties

To celebrate longevity, and as a reaction to throwaway culture, there’s a rise of repair parties. Master fixers throw a party where you can go and get your household things repaired. You can repair everything from tables and lamps to jewellery and clothing. Interior stylist Bhawana Bhatnagar is a staunch believer in the power of repair. She says that even solitary acts of repair can create ripples. “Through acts of repair we experience products as expressions of our collective knowledge. We learn the art of cherishing things for a longer time, hence building a connection. Repaired products become bearers and extensions of personhood,” she notes.


Follow the Japanese way sashiko

Sashiko is Japanese embroidery where intricate, typically geometric, designs are made using running stitch, commonly white stitches on indigo fabric. It started as a means to repair and strengthen old clothes to prolong their life, as earlier, fabric was very scarce in Japan and the poor had to conserve every scrap. These repairs soon turned into patterns, presumably because craftsmen wanted to make a dull necessity more interesting. Sashiko is not meant to be invisible. Rather, it highlights the rips, tears, frays, and fringes of garments with stitches in a contrasting thread and reinvent it to turn into something better than before – be it stronger fabric or a more beautiful design."

The Kannada film, which has Vikas and Sindhu Loknath in the lead, follows a ghost who is out to seek revenge, but turns out to be powerless to do so. “Though the protagonist is a ghost, the movie is in no way a horror story. There is a cute love story, along with lots of humour, emotions and action sequences. There are no jump-scares or horror elements. It is an entertainer that the full family can watch,” promises director Raj Pathipati. Filmmaker Som Singh, who is backing Kaanadante Maayavadanu adds that while there were offers to release the film in Tamil and Telugu as dubbed versions, he has decided to remake it. “We have approached Jayam-fame Nitin for Telugu and Siva Karthikeyan for the Tamil version. We should have confirmations soon,” he says.

The movie is slated for a January 31 release, but had been in the works for about four years. “It has taken time, and tested our patience too, (laughs). There are days when we very worried that the project might get shelved, but we pulled through and believe that it the film has shaped up well,” says Vikas. Sindhu echoes this and adds, “I’ve been asked often if I’ve taken a break from films. Honestly, this project has kept me busy over the last few years. People may call this my comeback film, but as far as I am concerned, it is a project that will be a benchmark in my career.”"

SEE ALL","Created: Jan 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Lifestyle,Gut health and stress,"Stress has an almost immediate effect on our gut and digestive system. This is why we are likely to experience spasms in the stomach when we are stressed, or feel butterflies when we are nervous. The gut and brain are connected to each other via a system of nerves called the Enteric Nervous System and are thus constantly communicating with each other. This is exactly why the gut is also called the second brain. What happens in our mind directly affects our gut and vice versa.

There are various ways how stress affects the gut
- Cause inflammation of the gut lining and increase intestinal permeability leading to leaky gut. Leaky gut is the core of most of health issues today.

- Shift body from a state of “rest and digest” to a state of “fight and flight”, thus shutting down all digestive processes.
- It can alter the ratio of good and bad gut bacteria and lead to dysbiosis, thereby dampening the immunity as 80% of the immunity lies in the gut. - Affect the production of hormones and neurotransmitters that are produced in the gut. A hormone called serotonin is a happy hormone and is made in the gut.
- It can alter bowel movements and either result in watery stools or constipation.
- Unmanaged stress can also result in behavioural changes when it comes to eating and make us binge eat, overeat or reach out for excess sugar, tea, coffee, fattening foods, fried foods that can further damage the gut.

How to reverse the effects
- Maintain a good probiotic ratio in the gut. One can focus on the intake of probiotics as well as prebiotics. This helps replenish the good bacteria in our gut and get rid of excess bad bacteria.
-Practice deep breathing.
-It is the quickest way to calm the mind and hence the gut.
-It helps shift our body from a state of stress to a state of calm in a matter of a few deep breaths.

-Add natural gut healers like pure cow ghee, coconut oil, omega 3 rich foods, L-glutamine, zinc, and selenium to your diet. Minerals like zinc play a vital role in keeping your intestinal lining healthy.



Precautions to be taken

Since stress is an inevitable part of life, the only precaution is to develop a better handle over stress by adopting effective stress management techniques. Deep breathing, yoga, meditation, gratitude practice, positive affirmations, visualisations, acceptance, sound therapy, art, are some of the best and most effective ways to manage stress levels on a day-to-day basis. Such stress-relieving activities should be practiced every day to ensure that your gut isn’t affected by the stressors you may encounter on a daily basis.

Also, the actress keeps her fans updated about her day to day life through her posts on the photo-sharing app. Well, not to forget that we also get the glimpse of her parties and vacation with the Kapoor Khandaan through her social media updates.

And today, she took to her Instagram account to post a beautiful picture of her enjoying the cold weather of Mumbai. The actress looked pretty in a pink t-shirt as she posed for the camera. The actress decided to go no makeup and no filter for the click. She captioned the post, ""Chilly mumbai evenings 💗 #nofilter"".


Check out the post here:


On the work front, the actress' last full-fledged outing was 'Dangerous Ishhq', which released in 2012. Post that, she has made only two appearances in guest roles — 'Bombay Talkies' in 2013 and 'Zero' in 2018."
"Created: Jan 19, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Gaurav Chopraa to join 'Sanjivani 2' post time leap,"Gaurav Chopraa, who was last seen in 'Aghori', is all set to join the cast of 'Sanjivani 2'. He will be introduced on the show post a three-year leap. So, what happens to Namit Khanna, who currently plays the male lead? Producer Siddharth P Malhotra replies, “Gaurav is joining the cast, but Namit’s character will be equally prominent. Gaurav’s entry will result in a love triangle between Surbhi Chandna, Gaurav and Namit’s characters. While Namit is a hustler, Gaurav will be seen as a principled and righteous man. His will be a more mature role.”

The show, which launched in August last year, will move to the 6.30 pm time slot. Ask him about Sanjivani not meeting expectations on the ratings’ charts and rumours of it shutting down soon and Siddharth says, “I won’t say that it has met our expectations, but the channel must have seen some merit to carry it on. According to the original contract, the show had to end on January 25. However, it has got an extension. It’s not going anywhere for another three months.”


Talking about his new project, Gaurav says, “Joining a show midway is 10 times tougher than associating with a project since its inception. But fortunately for me, it has always worked out, like it did in 'Uttaran'. So, I am not averse to it.”

The actor asserts that he doesn’t let ratings govern his decision while choosing a show. “Ratings never influence my decision. After so many years of experience, I have understood that there are several factors that determine the ratings of a show. So, if any actor thinks that he/she can guarantee certain numbers, they are mistaken. I just look for three things while choosing a project — good role, good story and good intention.”"
"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,"Now, Ponniyin Selvan becomes an animated film starring MGR","Even as Mani Ratnam has started filming his adaptation of Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan, a Chennai-based animation studio has completed production on an animated film based on the popular novel. What’s interesting is that they have created an animated version of late MG Ramachandran (MGR), who will be playing the lead character, Vanthiyathevan, in the film, which has been titled Vanthiyathevan: Ponniyin Selvan – Volume 1. Actor and politician, late MGR, had tried to turn the novel into a film in 1958, and had even finalised a multi-star cast, but the project remained an unrealised dream due to various reasons.
“It is impossible to capture the richness of Kalki’s prose in visuals in live-action unless you have a big budget, like what Mani Ratnam is doing now. We do not have such a budget, so we decided to go with animation. MGR was the first actor who wanted to adapt it for the big screen, so we decided to have him as the lead character by recreating him through motion capture,” says Dhavachelvan, who has scripted and directed this film. The dialogues and lyrics (the film will have four songs) are written by Madhan Karky. The team brought in performers who act like MGR and captured their motions. “Obviously, they could not perform exactly like MGR. We captured their actions and refined them in the key animation stage,” he reveals.


They have also created an animated character resembling Jayalalithaa for the female lead’s role, but since they aren’t sure of the legality over using the late actress-politician’s likeness, they have also created another character that is vaguely like Jayalalithaa. The rest of the characters aren’t based on any personality, adds the filmmaker.

The motion capture technology was earlier employed in Rajinikanth’s Kochadaiiyaan. Given that that film’s budget ran into crores, how was it possible for this team to make an entire film using this technology in a smaller budget? Dhavachelvan answers, “We are clear that our Ponniyin Selvan is for the Indian market and not for the international market. To be frank, we cannot compete with international animated films. We have managed to maintain a quality that will seem agreeable for the budget that we have worked on.”


While Kochadaiiyaan was criticised for the quality of its animation, the director says he and his team have used a different workflow and the movie has been made indigenously entirely. “We have made this film from start to finish in Chennai, with 126 people being part of our team,” informs Dhavachelvan, who has a computer science background. “We researched for two years before beginning production,” he adds.


The entire project has taken the team four years. “Ponniyin Selvan has five volumes, and we have completed animating the first volume into a feature film of 2 hours 20 minutes’ duration. The post-production work is going on,” says the director, who informs that apart from Tamil, he intends to release the film in the other three south Indian languages, and in Hindi. “We have not decided on releasing it in English. Even if we do, we will opt for subtitles instead of dubbing the film in the language,” he says."
"Updated: Jan 20, 2020, 13:24 IST",KAVYA CHRISTOPHER,Entertainment,Sruthi Hariharan: My awards have helped me bring back my self-confidence,"While actress Sruthi Hariharan insists that coming out with her #MeToo story early last year was one of the bravest things she has done, she also admits that she never expected it to turn her life completely upside down. “Suddenly, I was out of projects for various reasons. The teams of films that I had worked on and were ready for release had a tough time trying to figure out distribution. In fact, there are still ready-to-be-released films stuck without a release date. The film industry itself split into two groups — those who believed me and those who didn’t. So many people whom I considered my friends stopped being friends,” she tells us slowly. Incidentally, it is one of the films that hit the screens after she disclosed her story that has brought Sruthi back into the limelight. She has not only picked up the critics’ award for her performance in Naaticharami at the Filmfare, but she is also waiting for the clearance of a case against the film’s win at the national level before she takes her award for the same there as well. And in the meantime, in the midst of the career turmoil, it is her personal life and motherhood that has taken precedence.
""My husband, Raam (Kumar), and I welcomed a new member in our family — a baby girl who has beautifully taken over our lives. I guess everything happens for the good,” says Sruthi. Bangalore Times caught up with the actress at her home in the city, while she attended to little Janaki even as she calmly took on a volley of questions. Excerpts…

There have been quite a few awards, across platforms, for Naaticharami. What are your thoughts on that?

I am exalted. The film did not see a very good box office because of the climate in which it was released. I had just come out with my #MeToo story. The storyline, by itself, is compelling. It’s also very close to my heart. So, when it did not perform so well, I personally took the responsibility for that. But now that it’s receiving critical acclaim, it is quite a reprise. I am exalted with the National Awards and simultaneously with the Filmfare. Somewhere, I feel like our effort has been validated and, at some level, I do think that hard work and honesty pay off. It has brought back my confidence and the faith to continue doing what I love to do.
How different has life been since you told your story?
It has turned my life upside down. Coming out with my story was not an instinctive move, I had thought about it for more than a month. Tanushree Dutta had told her story in Bollywood, so had Chinmayi in the south. People were asking why isn’t anyone in the Kannada film industry saying anything. Is this place safe? But no industry really is ‘safe’. I did go into this whole process of introspection and questioned myself about the repercussions of coming out, too. Then, finally, I had to say it and I did, through social media. It was never the way I imagined it to be. Not only did the newspapers and news channels completely turn my story upside down, the film industry itself did not receive it well at all. It split the industry into two parts, and ultimately it became like who is right, who is wrong, who do you believe and who don’t you believe? It became this dirty game, and that is something that I had never foreseen.

How did you see this panning out? What were your expectations?
I wanted to stop being guilty by not speaking up. The industry is really not safe for women. At some level, I also wanted to make sure that this man does not behave like how he behaved with me ever again. What I understand is that him, and the other predators are victims of the system that has existed for so long that it makes them believe that it is okay for them to behave the way they do. Yes, I am calling them victims of the system. They think it is alright. They have wives and daughters, but do they take a step back and think about the way the behave? I don’t think they do. It is important at some level that as women, we raise our voice and say, hey it is not okay anymore. Because the more we keep quiet, it is like our silence is allowing them to continue to think that what they are doing is alright.
Silence is safe; it is easy to be quiet. But we live in dangerous times and if we don’t come together and stand up for what is right — it is only going to be a ride downhill. I think it is important that we voice our opinion, even if it is an unpopular one.
I expected it to become news. But did I expect to not have work anymore? No. Did I expect my entire credibility to be washed out? No. Did I expect this market that we actors have when our films are released, to completely be gone? No. I did not expect any of that.
I have always believed in the secret that YOU make things happen and that it comes from within you. But the past one year has been completely out of my hands, and I haven’t been able to control anything that happened. And, in a way, I have surrendered. I have learnt to let go, and go with the flow so I could believe in something much bigger. It has been a great spiritual journey for me.
I do have friends in the industry who call and say, whenever you’re ready to get back to work we should collaborate, but then the universe so had it in a way that I had to have my daughter now.

What is the current situation with cases surrounding #MeToo?
With respect to the legal case, it is still in court. The defamation suit that they had filed was never Rs 5 crore, as reported in media. There was no money at all. The criminal case I have filed is also in limbo, between the police and the court. So legally, I have understood that unless I pursue it actively, nothing is going to come out of it.

Are you pursuing it?
No, I am not.
I do not know how much the justice system can help to ascertain my truth. I don’t know whether legal justice is what I seek. To be clear, legal justice is not what I seek. What I seek is what I have got. What I wanted, I got, the moment I put my post out there. For me, that was the end of it. I did not start the battle and the war. I know this is the same for every single woman who came out in every single industry. It has come to a dead end. But honestly, that is all we seek. We seek awareness of the fact that sexual harassment exists. We seek awareness in terms of behaviour. How men and women need to behave in the work space. So I guess, that’s already done. So, do I seek legal justice? I do not. It became a legal case only after the defamation suit was filed, and I had to retaliate. It takes money and time from my end and a lot of emotional and mental trauma to go out there and continue fighting a battle that I never wanted in the first place. Hence, I don’t see the need. I am at peace in my little world, with my family and I am very excited about the kind of work I can create henceforth, rather than fight a battle that I do not know if I will win.

Isn’t that disheartening?
Yes, it is very disheartening. But it is the truth. I remember meeting Bhanwari Devi at a conference recently and she told me “Don’t give up. Zor se lado”. She has been fighting for 42 years. She was gangraped. What happened to me is not 1% of what she went through. Then I came back home and thought, is this worth my time, my energy and my emotions? But, I do intend to use my voice in a different manner, to set things straight.

Any regrets at this point?
There are times when I sit alone and think to myself, that if had kept quiet, how different would life be. I don’t regret having come out, I don’t regret having spoken the truth. It has given me a lot of strength. I had said this before I had my daughter — that I am doing this because if ever I have a daughter, I want to see a better and a safer world for her. If I have not tried to make a difference, then I am being a hypocrite. So that way, I do not regret. But, I am human, and I am a real person; I have gone through my share of depression because of this, I have, therefore, taken professional help. I do introspect, I think that things would have probably been different. I see some amazing cinema being made, and I do think I probably could have been a part of it... if things did not pan out the way they did.

The National Awards for Naaticharami are not presented because of a complaint by Kannada filmmaker Dayal Padmanabhan. Your thoughts on that?
I think it calls for a celebration that so many awards were won by Kannada films at the National Awards this year. For one film to win five awards was also huge. Yet, it’s very sad that even the people within our industry are not letting our own industry grow. It was quite unnecessary of him to file that complaint. I think the intent of the case was very immature and uncalled for. The only way we could have attended the awards was if we apologised. Why would any of us (the five who won the awards) do that? It’s not the truth. We know that we will win the case and at some point, we will receive these awards.

Your role in this film was rather bold, yet contemporary. What kind of emotional and mental preparation did you go through for this role?
My mother is a single parent. And I have grown up most of my adult life without my father in my life. I have seen my mother pine for my father in many ways than one. The process of letting go of a person from your life is never complete. It is a void that always exists. And that is the core of Naaticharami. In Sanskrit, it means ‘I shall never let you go’, and it is a promise that you make when you take your vows in the marital ceremony. The film is about the process of letting go. One of the important aspect of letting go is the physical aspect of it. And we as women are naturally more monogamous. But at some level, there exists this sexual desire which is important to be addressed. In the Indian society, for a woman to speak about her desire continues to be taboo. It was intriguing for me to play Gowri in this film, because I constantly had my mother at the back of my mind. I don’t think any other form of preparation was required for this role. The character was only required to react to the situation. She was never the cause of the situation; she was only the aftermath of it. And the story was a very personal one. Luckily for me, our director (Manjunatha Somashekara Reddy, also known as Mansore) was a man who was open to collaboration. I am glad that he, who chose to say a woman’s story, had the sensitivity and the feministic perspective to show such a subject aesthetically. At no point was I uncomfortable doing certain scenes, because there are scenes that can make you squirm in your seat. There is a scene that we imply upon masturbation. It is high time films talked about it. There was a lot of discussion about how these scenes ought to be shot and that is how it should be. It was actually, quite liberating for me as an actor to perform something this real. I look back at Naaticharami with a lot of fond memories and happiness that I could portray a real woman on screen.

Do you see yourself being a part of any other industry right now, apart from Kannada?
I am a Bengaluru girl. I grew up here, I know the culture, I know the energy that exists here. I think it’s very personal for me to be part of stories that come from Bengaluru. And it is so easy for me to play them. Be it Sahana in Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, Nandini in Beautiful Manasugalu or even Gowri in Naaticharami, they have been real women. I do not see myself anywhere else, and I say this in spite of being a Tamilian and in spite of being married to a Malayali.


Speaking of your marriage, which was under wraps for the longest time… why?

For me, the choice to be married or not married was a very personal one. I have always been committed to the man I am now married to, for the last 10 years. Marriage was something that happened for our families. They wanted us to make it official. And when it happened, it was a very small gathering in Dubai. After that, I carried on with my work. I had enough films in the pipeline. It was a personal celebration and it remained that way. I did not have the opportunity or the time to make it a huge announcement in social media or through the media. Hence, it remained under wraps. ‘Very conveniently’ — a lot of people may think. So be it, I really don’t care. But when it did come out, I honestly breathed a sigh of relief. Because I understand a public figure’s life is invariably public. Though I come from a middle-class family, I have to accept at some point of time that I am a public figure and I cannot just have a personal life. It came out the way it did, and I am glad it did.



What is the way forward now?

Right now, I have taken a sabbatical. Somehow, priorities have changed post motherhood. But there are offers, and I am looking at how I can be involved without letting it affect my time with my daughter. There is a bit of writing too, that has happened. We have all been talking about how women should start getting into different departments of film making, how it is imperative to make sensitive cinema, through women. This is also the right time to slowly transition into that. So yes, I would be starting off fresh, maybe, not so much as an actor, but at least as a writer/assistant director. I cannot wait to pull up my socks and get back to work. It wasn’t easy to get to where I was. It was a journey of making all kinds of random choices, of seeing success and failure; and I know that it is only a matter of time to get to that peak — with a little more of hard work."
"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Taking Carnatic music to the younger generation,"It was a regular Saturday evening for most of us, but not for the rasikas who’d gathered at the auditorium of Music Academy. After all, it was the grand finale of the 9th edition of the Times Thyagaraja Awards, which would be followed by a spell-binding kutcheri by Sangeetha Kalanidhi Padma Shri Aruna Sairam. The audience — which included family and friends of the six finalists, as well as connoisseurs of Carnatic music — waited with bated breath for the participants to showcase their vocal prowess on stage and also find out who took home the coveted title. After several rounds of auditions and a gruelling semi-final elimination round, Pranathi Ganapuram, Jaya Bargavi S, Samanvi, Purva Dhanashree Cotah, Kausthubh P Chandramouli and Srividya Vadlamani made it to the grand finale. The six finalists performed to the best of their abilities, each one exploring a raga. They were ably accompanied by Shreelakshmi Bhatt (on violin) and Sarvajit Krishna (on mridangam).

It was a tough competition, and our judges for the evening — Kalaimamani Bhushani Kalyanaraman, Kalaimamani Geetha Raja, Kalaimamani Dr Shobana Vignesh, Aruna Ranganathan, Viji Krishnan and Chinmaya Sisters, Uma and Radhika — admitted they had a tough time choosing the winners.


Based on raga, niraval and swaram, Samanvi (nominated by Arkay Convention Centre) was announced the winner of Times Thyagaraja Awards and she received the trophy, certificate and gift voucher worth a lakh from Aruna Sairam. While Kausthubh P Chandramouli (nominated by Carnatica) was adjudged the first runner-up, Srividya Vadlamani (nominated by Arkay Convention Centre) won both the second runner-up position and Rasikas Choice Award for getting the maximum views for the audition video in the Times Thyagaraja Awards’ Facebook page. The other finalists were also awarded with certificates and gift vouchers.
Speaking on the occasion, Shobana said, “They are all immensely talented and have it in them to make it big. I’m happy to be associated with the Times Thyagaraja Awards, which takes Carnatic music to the young generation.”
While Geetha Raja said it was a delight to see young students perform, Viji Krishnan added, “It’s amazing how these kids brought out that kutcheri effect within 16 minutes that each one of them were given to perform. As artistes, we know how difficult it is to please everyone in the audience, but I’m sure these youngsters have done it.”
On her part, Uma said, “The Times Thyagaraja Awards motivates youngsters and gives them the courage to perform in front of public. The preparation and hard work they put in not only helped them in this competition, but will also help them blossom into a wholesome artiste.”


Radhika added, “It’s not an easy task to sing in front of so many people, but these youngsters did it with confidence.”

Bhushani Kalyanaraman had a suggestion for the participants. “Azhutham thiruthamana ragathila concentrate pannanum. I urge them to choose kritis that can be challenging to perform.” Aruna Ranganathan said, “Times of India, chance-eyilla! The journey of a student begins when his/her parents decide to teach them music and find them a good guru. Both of these, I think, are divine interventions. Every kriti they chose to sing was taught to them by their gurus… that’s what foundation is all about. I’d like to convey my wishes to the students, their gurus and their parents, who are so passionate about music.”


It was then time for Aruna Sairam to take the stage. Accompanied by Kalaimamani J Vaidyanathan (on mridangam), Vittal Rangan (on violin), Dr S Karthick (on ghatam) and Seethalakshmi (on tanpura), the ace artiste wowed audience with her rendition of soulful kritis like Ganamoorthe, Amba Sauramba, Soundara Raajam Ashraye, Sabhapathikku and the ever-favourite, Theertha Vittala. Her flawless energy engulfed the rasikas,

who lost themselves in the beautiful sound of music.

"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,TV,Sunny Hinduja to do a cameo in TV show 'Mere Dad Ki Dulhan',"There are very few actors who would agree to do a TV show while working in films, but actor Sunny Hinduja sees it as an opportunity that he got to play a role in the TV show 'Mere Dad Ki Dulhan'. The actor, who was last seen in 'Mardaani 2', will make an entry in the show featuring Varun Badola and Shweta Tiwari, this week. He will be seen as Dr Anurag Malhotra, a 43-year-old orthopaedic surgeon who will try to impress Guneet Sikka (Shweta Tiwari). ""Anurag is a single parent who is looking for a companion for himself and a mother for his daughter. I found the character very relatable. He is looking for a companion for his old age and Guneet comes across as someone who will be perfect for him,"" shares Sunny.

One of the reasons why Sunny agreed to do the show was that it was an interesting cameo. ""I have done TV shows earlier, but only those that do not go on for years or have an interesting concept. I agreed to do this show since the role was a cameo and the show is not the usual saas-bahu saga. I was looking forward to do something interesting on TV. Fortunately, I had some time before I start shooting for other projects, so this looked like an opportunity in every way,"" says the actor, who says that he doesn’t mind being a part of TV shows that have some realistic content. ""While working in films, I don’t mind doing TV shows as long as I am associating with something that is realistic and is a finite series,"" he adds.

Working with actors like Varun Badola and Shweta Tiwari was also something that inspired Sunny to take up the show. ""They are both very good actors. I have seen their shows and to work with them is a privilege,"" he says."

The actress has been signed up to host the music show, Haadu Karnataka, which will hit TV screens soon. Raghu Dixit and V Harikrishna will serve as judges on the show. Chandana tell us, “I am excited about my new journey as a host. I’ve always wanted to be a television host, but when I got the opportunity to work on Raja Rani (which marked her first stint on a TV show), I took it up. Being a host requires different set of skills, and I have already started practising at home to get the language and mannerisms right. Once the show starts, I don’t want to go wrong. I admire Akul Balaji and Srujan Lokesh for their energy and spontaneity as hosts, which is something that I am going to try for Haadu Karnataka. The only issue is that making the contestants feel comfortable may be a challenge, as each of them comes from a different socio-economic background. I also need to work on striking a rapport with the judges as well. Also, considering that it is a music show, I think the fact that I have briefly trained in Carnatic music could come in handy while hosting the show.”

According to a source from the show, the title track for Haadu Karnataka has been written by Vasuki Vaibhav. The show will have representations from all the 30 districts of Karnataka. Singers between the ages of 6 and 60 are eligible to participate. The show will kick-start with just over 30 contestants, which will include singers with and without formal training."
"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,"I was offered Maidaan in December, I’ll shoot from January end: Priyamani","The year 2020 looks packed for Priyamani. The actress, who’s shooting for a handful of films, including the Telugu remake of Asuran with Venkatesh, has just signed on a new film — Maidaan with Ajay Devgn. Interestingly, Priyamani replaces Keerthy Suresh in the Amit Ravindernath Sharma (of Badhaai Ho fame) directorial, which would have marked her Bollywood debut.
Priyamani, who was shooting in a forest in Kerala, tells us, “Boney Kapoor sir approached me for the film; I got this offer in December. I met director Amit at Boneyji’s office. He told me the gist of the story and gave me a brief about my role. The way Amit narrated the character drew me in and I just couldn’t say no. I’ll start shooting for my portions by January end.”


Maidaan will trace the golden years of Indian football and has Ajay Devgn playing football coach Syed Abdul Rahim. The actress will be playing Ajay’s wife in the film. “It feels so good to play a real-life character on the big screen. I’m looking forward to working with Ajay Devgn sir and Amit, and of course under Boney sir’s production,” she says.

Interestingly, Priyamani is said to be playing Sasikala in Vijay’s Thalaivi, a biopic of actress and former CM of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa. Ask her if she had to work the shoot schedule of her other films to accommodate this one and she says, “I can’t comment on Thalaivi now, but fortunately, my husband and my manager both worked out the dates to ensure a smooth shoot for the entire crew of Maidaan and Asuran remake so that dates don’t clash.”

Meanwhile

A source in the know tells us that Keerthy shot for a day for the sports drama in October before both she and the makers mutually decided to part ways. The source says, “Keerthy was to play Ajay’s wife and a mother. But she had lost a lot of weight from the time she had committed to the film to when she shot in October, and hence, didn’t look the part. So, she opted out of the film. However, there’s no bad blood and the production house is hoping to collaborate with her soon for another project.”


We also hear that date clash was another factor that prompted Keerthy’s decision. “The film didn’t go on floors as planned because casting took a while; the makers wanted every character to look authentic. And now, Keerthy’s dates were clashing with those that she had allotted for her other films in the south, including Rajinikanth’s movie with Siva, and she felt it would be in the best interest of both her and the makers of Maidaan that she opt out,” another source tells us."
"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Entertainment,A 20-minute art face-off between Bengaluru artists,"Bengaluru witnessed a quirky riot of colours over the weekend — one that involved the easel, music and a lot of fun. Some 12 artists competed against each other to bag the top slot at the maiden edition of Art Battle Bengaluru. The live painting global tournament saw several art lovers come together to encourage and support the cause of art. Speaking about the first edition of the event in namma ooru, Pooja Shirali, an organiser, said, “We got to know about this global tournament from a friend, who had participated in the Seattle chapter of it. We found out that this is the world’s largest live art tournament, which takes place in more than 60 cities. But, apparently, it had never happened in India before, which is why we wanted to do this here.”

There were two rounds in the competition, two winners from which were then pitted against each other in the final round. As the artists continued painting, the audiences moved around them in a circle, viewing each artist in action. The winners were chosen by the audience. “The artists weren’t given any theme to follow. They could paint whatever they wanted to, within a time frame of 20 minutes. We did have applicants from other cities as well, but for the first edition, we decided to have only local artists,” says Kaavya Sampath, another organiser.

Nanvi Singh Jhala — a student of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology — was the youngest participant in the art event. Sharing her experience, Nanvi said, “It was both crazy and intense to compete live in front of an audience, with music playing in the background. But I enjoyed the vibe of it. We should have more of such events in the city, as they open the door to many opportunities.”

Chetan S Murthy, a professional artist from Bengaluru, was declared the winner, after he bagged maximum audience votes. He will now compete on the national level. The winner at the national level will then compete at the international tournament, which is scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in October this year."

We forage on the farm for veggies and fruits, drink coffee that’s been freshly ground and eat local Malnad food. I’m loving every moment” says the actor. Skanda’s family owns coffee estates in Chikmagalur, so he’s always had an affinity towards nature and agriculture. “It’s the coffee-picking season now, so I will be busy until February. It’s a process I enjoy, so I’m spending most of my time here, being hands-on at the job the entire time,” he tells us."

"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,Entertainment,Amjad Khan: I was told last year that 'Gul Makai' would not be released in Pakistan,"'Gul Makai', a film based on the life of Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, is slated to release on January 31, almost a year after its making. As the film comes close to its release, the director of the film, Amjad Khan, is hoping that ""there's is no politics about this film and people should know that this film presents the life and struggles of Malala, who is an advocate of the right to education. She happens to come from Pakistan, but she is a global citizen.""

The director, who was in the city recently for the film’s promotions, said that one of the biggest setbacks for him last year was when he was told that 'Gul Makai' would not be releasing in Pakistan. ""Last year, we had the screening of the film with representatives from different countries, including India and Pakistan. It was a special screening of the biopic by the UN in London on January 25. Post screening, there was a gala dinner attended by all the dignitaries who were invited for the screening. I went to every table during the dinner taking feedback for my film. When I went to interact with Pakistani diplomats, who looked happy and clapped for the film, they told me, 'Bahut achchi film banayi aap ne, lekin ye film Pakistan mein release nahi karenge'. I asked why and they replied, 'Bahut zyada sach nahi dikha diya aapne? itna sach dikhayenge to hum kaise release hone denge.' So I asked them to officially declare it and they told me that 'we will not do that, we will just tell distributors to not pick the film'. So the film is not releasing in Pakistan,"" said Amjad, who is the Goodwill Ambassador of the UN agency that fights malnutrition across the world.


The film was also screened for Malala and her family. Interestingly, Amjad revealed that he started making the film without taking any permissions from Malala, but after completion, the film was first shown to her and her family. ""When her family was watching the film, it had to be stopped four times. Malala's mother screamed when she saw the first scene, which was Malala getting shot. She broke down in tears while watching the film and I could see the pain in her eyes. After watching the film, she said, 'Film mujhe achchi lagi lekin film achchi nahi hai.' She said that because the film brought back all her memories. It often happens that when you have suffered something painful, it is difficult to recall that or even think about it. Since I have not taken any cinematic liberties while making the film and I am presenting facts as they are, it was difficult for the family to watch it. Malala also saw the film and said she liked it,"" shared Amjad, who said the biggest challenge for him was to stay true to facts. ""This is not an 'entertaining' film, it is an inspiring film that aims at telling people why Malala is the person that we know today. The film does not focus on her achievements alone, it focuses on the hardships she faced since she was nine,"" concluded Amjad."
"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 01:00 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Neena Gupta: I didn’t do anything with the thought that I want to go against society,"It took Neena Gupta years of waiting and a social media post to gradually reclaim her place as one India's finest actresses; a point she proved with her performance in the National Award winner, Badhaai Ho. She’s now one of her generation’s busiest actresses. It’s not the screen time that matters to her. It’s what the story is trying to say. Ahead of Panga’s release, she spoke to BT about expressing herself through social media and deriving strength to live life on her own terms. Excerpts
In an interview, you mentioned that you have a small role in Panga, but you still went ahead and did it. What attracted you to the part?
It’s an important story. The character, though small, is that of a mother and offers an interesting, realistic take. You often hear mothers saying, “Bas, ab hum tere liye kuch nahi karenge.” But when the need arises, she is the first to jump to her children’s rescue. Yeh aur baat hai ki yeh Jaya ke comeback ki kahani hai; in our country, women are not encouraged to take on sports as a career, especially when it’s something niche like kabaddi, quintessentially known as the guys’ game. That underlying discussion in the film impressed me.

Do you think that not encouraging girls as much towards sports has to do with the societal mindset?
Cuts in…It’s a societal thing -- a big chunk of society still believes ki ek accha ladka mil jaaye beti ko, haath peele kar dein, bacche ho jaayein, ghar sambhal le. People still think that women are meant for this. In 99 percent cases, this is the reason a woman doesn’t get the push and encouragement when she needs it. Traditionally, our society has always seen women as homemakers and men as bread-earners. The demarcations are engraved in stone, perhaps.
But you have never led your life on the basis of these demarcations. Your decisions -- whether it was to have a child, get married, or have a career of your choice -- have never been dictated by societal norms.
I didn’t do anything with the thought that I want to go against society or bend any rules. This is how I am and in spite of being like that, I pushed my daughter Masaba to get married to her lover, instead of having a live-in relationship. This dichotomy has to do with the way I have been brought up. Even though I did things which were not in accordance with the society’s norms, deep down, I am an orthodox woman. I have changed with the times, lekin khurech ke dekhoge toh, kahin na kahin you will find that orthodox woman inside me. In a way, it’s good because I don’t get carried away with things. Circumstances are changing for women but it’s scary because men are not changing at the same pace, which can lead to trouble. Women are independent and not taking sh*t from men anymore. When they didn’t have their financial independence, they had to put up with everything the man said. Nahin to kahan jaati woh? That’s not the case now.

It must have been a hard path for you to follow, where do you derive the strength?
From myself! I look after myself, I’m disciplined and honest. I don’t say one thing and do another. You have to put your foot down and reach out for what you want. Life is too short to wait for someone to bring it to you. Today, everyone’s life today is complicated. Nanak dukhiya sab sansar...there’s pain and trouble everywhere you go. I’m happy even with my complicated life. If something untoward happens, I cry for days and weeks, but I move on. It’s not as if I forget my pain but I move on. It’s a difficult and stressful life that we all lead but I have learnt to see happiness even in my unhappiness.

Have you passed on some of these lessons to your daughter whose life has been under media scrutiny?
I don’t think I had to pass on these lessons. She’s seen me fighting my own battles throughout. Of course, she is her own person. You know how mothers feel when they see their daughter separating from her husband. At that time, she and I were in pain, but we moved on. Each time that I feel low, I loudly tell myself, ‘Chal aage chal Neena!’ You have to do that.

Talking about your work, you lend every character, irrespective of screen-time, a certain gravitas. Do you dig deep into your emotional coffers for that?
It comes organically to me. I love acting and I am the happiest when I am playing an interesting character. For me, enacting a part means being in the character’s avatar, feeling the lines that I am saying and listening to the co-actor for actions and reactions. My experiences and observations also come in handy. I make a mental note of things I see and hear around me.

Last year, you won awards for your performance in Badhaai Ho. Did that change your perspective towards your work?
The real difference occurs when people start approaching me with more and better quality of work. That’s the real kick.

You took to social media and wrote to the industry at large, asking for work. That might have seemed odd to many, but do you think that turned things around for you?
Yes, it did. People may have reasons to detest social media, but it gave me a lot. When I wrote that note on my page, and I started meeting people after that, they seemed so moved. They actually felt bad that I could write something like that, sensing the frustration with which I wrote it. Anubhav Sinha was the first to approach me with Mulk. And then, many filmmakers came around and things changed. The last two years have been busy and a lot of fun.


A few months ago, when Saand Ki Aankh was up for release, you again wrote a message on social media, this time about casting older women for older roles. That sparked the ageism debate…
(Laughs!) That statement was taken out of context. Galat samajh liya mujhe. Fact is that there are a lot of roles meant for younger women and far lesser roles for older women. The backstory is that, much before I wrote that post, I had messaged Anurag Kashyap. I had heard that he was making Saand Ki Aankh. I wrote to him saying that it’s a good role for me. He replied saying that even though he would have cast me, the financers wanted younger actors for it. So, it is not me or anyone else who decides these things. So, who am I to take offence? I was only expressing a wish -- I meant to say that I wish I could do that film kyunki itne acche roles aur scripts kam aate hain. That was made out to be something else. Bhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu did a fantastic job. Even I did older women roles when I was 28. I’ve been playing older characters for many years. Kya bhool gaye hain sab? Actors find it difficult to get great roles. If I was in Bhumi and Taapsee’s shoes, even I would have jumped at that script. The mistake I made was to put up something that was in my heart on a public platform. You need to be cautious with social media.


You really seem to have taken a liking to social media. Your pictures and videos in a glamorous avatar have surprised many simply because it’s not something that most women in your age-bracket might do.
I was always like this -- one moment in a sari and the next moment in a pair of shorts (laughs!). People have not seen me like this because of the work I was doing. Remember, I was playing older characters? I was always clad in saris or salwar suits. Social media has given me a chance to show the world that this is also something that I can do.


Did your daughter, Masaba, have a role to play in this?
Sometimes, I wear Masaba’s creations or take her inputs, and sometimes, I wear my own outfits. Like the yellow dress I wore in the video posted on January 1, is my own. I just believe that there is no harm in flaunting what you know is good about your body. Like I know I don’t have a bikini body, so I won’t flaunt it. The surprise in seeing me in a certain way has to do with years of conditioning."

What’s unusual about her exit is that she hasn’t been voted out, but ousted because of resorting to violence against her ex boyfriend Vishal Aditya Singh. The makers decided to take the drastic step after the actress hit Vishal repeatedly with a pan. However, Madhurima doesn’t regret her actions. In fact, she says that she was instigated by Vishal, which was his game plan since he wanted her out at any cost. She also says that it’s over between her and Vishal. Read on...
How would you describe your experience in Bigg Boss? You were eliminated because you hit Vishal...
It was a nice experience. I survived for a month-and-a-half. I could have survived longer, agar maine yeh harkat nahi ki hoti. But I did it because mere self-respect ko bohot zyada chot pohochate jaa raha tha repeatedly. I couldn’t take it anymore. Of course, I regret being out of the show, but not my actions. Jo hua so hua. I regret that I disrespected the rules of the show and not anything else. Anybody in my place would have reacted in the same way or maybe more harshly. I reacted the way I did because he disrespected me a lot of times. Woh cheez waise nikalni thi aur nikal gayi. People get to see just an hour-long episode. So, they don’t know what happens throughout the day and what I went through. He targeted my career. Uske liye mera career zero tha. Woh baar baar yahi keh rahe the, ‘Tum mere paison par pal rahi ho aur tum meri wajah se ho yahaan. Tumhara koi wajood nahi hai, pehle woh banao... Chal phut yahaan se aur main tujhpe thookunga bhi nahin’. That’s not how you talk to a girl. In fact, even Salman sir reprimanded him saying that no one talks to a guy like that, let alone a girl. Woh kitna jhelegi, phir ek dinn toh phootna hi tha. Even when things were getting better between us, he would make me feel lonely. He went around giving good morning hugs and kisses to other women. Of course, I would feel bad about it. In fact, I felt disgusted by his actions; I felt left out. According to me, whatever he did, was done deliberately. It was his plan and strategy to make me feel lonely. It was clear that he didn’t want me on the show and he said it when he saw me enter the house. His actions were all planned to get me thrown out of the show. He provoked me. I should have been stronger, but I was an emotional fool. I forgave him and tried to mend things again between us. I should have focused on my game rather than concentrating on him. I hold him responsible for being eliminated from the show.


Do you regret the fact that you were violent towards him?

I was instigated by him. Mujhe uss time jo sahi laga maine kiya. I took care of the fact that bum par zyada nahi lagti hai. Lagi hai, but woh overacting bhi karta hai. He did not have to limp.


Though you two were mostly at loggerheads on the show, the audience also saw some romantic moments between the two of you. They were wondering if you would rekindle your relationship with him. Do you feel you got carried away and it was too much too soon? No, I loved him. I don’t regret those moments because that’s when I realised what was happening with me wasn’t right, as a result of which, issues between us escalated. Also, I didn’t want to feel like I didn’t give my 100 per cent to the relationship. So, I don’t regret the romantic moments between him and me. Those moments made me realise that he was playing games just to be on the show and throw me out of it.


After seeing you two fight on Nach Baliye, one expected you and Vishal to handle things maturely on BB, but that clearly wasn’t the case...

After what happened on Nach Baliye, including venting my frustration against him, I still went back to him. I decided to forget and let go of things. But the same things were repeated on BB and I just couldn’t control myself. At least, both of us have got closure now. We are not meant for each other and this stint was proof of that. I become a different person — negative and bitter — when I am with him. I have never hit the man in any of my relationships. Main woh bann jaati hoon jo main nahi hoon. I don’t hate him anymore. I feel bad for him and pity him. I don’t know how I will react if I see him, but I don’t hate him. Ab meri bhadaas nikal gayi hai toh it’s all over. There is no chance of getting back with him ever. I think now we will stay away from each other. I got evicted at the right time. Isse zyada main reh jaati toh aur zyada ganda ho jaata. Right time par hi yeh sahi cheez ho gayi. Jo main hoon nahi, main wohi banti jaa rahi thi. I regret the way I behaved on the show, but not for my actions towards Vishal.

"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,Entertainment,Amjad Khan: I was told last year that 'Gul Makai' would not be released in Pakistan,"'Gul Makai', a film based on the life of Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, is slated to release on January 31, almost a year after its making. As the film comes close to its release, the director of the film, Amjad Khan, is hoping that ""there's is no politics about this film and people should know that this film presents the life and struggles of Malala, who is an advocate of the right to education. She happens to come from Pakistan, but she is a global citizen.""

The director, who was in the city recently for the film’s promotions, said that one of the biggest setbacks for him last year was when he was told that 'Gul Makai' would not be releasing in Pakistan. ""Last year, we had the screening of the film with representatives from different countries, including India and Pakistan. It was a special screening of the biopic by the UN in London on January 25. Post screening, there was a gala dinner attended by all the dignitaries who were invited for the screening. I went to every table during the dinner taking feedback for my film. When I went to interact with Pakistani diplomats, who looked happy and clapped for the film, they told me, 'Bahut achchi film banayi aap ne, lekin ye film Pakistan mein release nahi karenge'. I asked why and they replied, 'Bahut zyada sach nahi dikha diya aapne? itna sach dikhayenge to hum kaise release hone denge.' So I asked them to officially declare it and they told me that 'we will not do that, we will just tell distributors to not pick the film'. So the film is not releasing in Pakistan,"" said Amjad, who is the Goodwill Ambassador of the UN agency that fights malnutrition across the world.


The film was also screened for Malala and her family. Interestingly, Amjad revealed that he started making the film without taking any permissions from Malala, but after completion, the film was first shown to her and her family. ""When her family was watching the film, it had to be stopped four times. Malala's mother screamed when she saw the first scene, which was Malala getting shot. She broke down in tears while watching the film and I could see the pain in her eyes. After watching the film, she said, 'Film mujhe achchi lagi lekin film achchi nahi hai.' She said that because the film brought back all her memories. It often happens that when you have suffered something painful, it is difficult to recall that or even think about it. Since I have not taken any cinematic liberties while making the film and I am presenting facts as they are, it was difficult for the family to watch it. Malala also saw the film and said she liked it,"" shared Amjad, who said the biggest challenge for him was to stay true to facts. ""This is not an 'entertaining' film, it is an inspiring film that aims at telling people why Malala is the person that we know today. The film does not focus on her achievements alone, it focuses on the hardships she faced since she was nine,"" concluded Amjad."

"Created: Jan 20, 2020, 01:00 IST",Kashika.Bindrani@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,Not just in the mind: Fear of falling ill is also an illness,"Do you frequently worry about suffering from a grave illness even when there is no real reason to do so? If you have some affliction, do you inadvertently exaggerate the symptoms? It is possible that you have hypochondriasis
Most of us worry about our health from time to time, and sometimes unnecessarily so. However, for some people, worrying takes on a much larger proportion – so much so, that they are overcome by a debilitating, overpowering and crippling fear – that of falling sick. Hypochondriasis, referred to in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as an Illness Anxiety Disorder, is the fear of getting a life threatening physical illness despite repeated medical assurances against it. ""It is natural to worry about one's health at times, but if the fear becomes so strong that it disrupts one's daily life, causing interference in work and social functioning, it signals a deeper problem. Illness Anxiety Disorder is characterised by a preoccupation with the fear of getting or already having a serious disease,"" says Sonakshi Gandhi, clinical psychologist. Megha Aggarwal, a research scholar in psychology, adds, ""Since the complaints concern the physical health of the patient, the first and foremost step is to get those symptoms evaluated by a general physician. If the physician feels that the symptoms are not related to a concrete physical illness, they may refer the person to a mental health professional.""


Are you suffering from Hypochondriasis?
According to experts, the defining symptoms of the disorder are:
1. Persistent preoccupation with the fear or idea of having one or more serious diseases or deformities and misinterpreting the symptoms. 2. Not feeling reassured by the results of medical evaluations, even though tests do not identify adequate physical explanation for the believed disease.
3. Refusal to accept advice and reassurance by doctors.
4. Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition because it runs in the family.
5. Repeatedly checking the body for signs of illness or disease and an increased sensitivity to bodily functions.
6. Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks
7. Frequently searching the internet for causes, symptoms or possible illnesses.

Google Syndrome, anxiety linked to hypochondriasis

""Hypochondriasis is a disorder of cognition and perception. Misinterpretation of body sensations is an essential aspect of it, which happens when an individual has had past experiences with illness (with themselves and/or others) that may lead to development of faulty assumptions about
symptoms and diseases,"" says Aditi Bansal, a clinical psychologist. Other explanations for this disorder, as per experts are:
It’s in the genes: People who have a close relative with hypochondriasis are more likely to develop it themselves.
Links to other conditions: Other psychiatric disorders have been linked to this disorder. A high percentage of patients with hypochondriasis also have depression, panic disorder, OCD, or generalised anxiety disorder.
Google Syndrome: Also known as cyberchondria, this refers to a condition where one identifies their symptoms with a chronic disease based on the information available online or in other forms of media.The disorder can also develop in response to overprotective parenting

'The referrals that come to the professionals are limited and the follow ups are not regular'

Priyanka Malhotra Kathuria, visiting psychologist in the Indian Air Force, Rajokri, Delhi, points out, ""Most patients are okay waiting in long queues for physical check-ups. But it is difficult to convince them to visit a psychologist or a psychiatrist as they're either unaware of this disorder or are unwilling to accept that their problem could have psychological explanations."" Adds Aditi, ""Since the patient finds it difficult to accept that their problem might be psychological, the referrals that come to mental health professionals are limited in number, and, the follow ups are not regular.""
Therapists say that while the stigma attached to mental health is significantly reducing, there is still a need for awareness and acceptance. ""Many patients seek validation from their family who try to convince the patient that they do not have a serious disease. This does not work in the long run. Family members should instead help the person see a pattern in their questions and urge them to consult a specialist rather than rely on them or the internet,"" says Sonakshi.

Join support groups, go for counselling & therapy sessions


According to Dr Naina Kapoor, a Delhi-based counselling psychologist, treatments for the disorder include several options:

1. If the condition is not severe, simply discussing about the fear of the illness helps. But, in most cases, psychological counselling is considered the first step to overcome health related anxiety.

2. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective therapy for Illness Anxiety Disorder. CBT experts aim to assist the patient in recognising, and then reducing the behaviours associated with hypochondria most efficiently.

3. Being physically and mentally active, and exercising, helps in releasing stress and balance the energy. It helps the patients view the disorder in a positive light and is one of the safest and most natural ways to overcome the health anxiety.

4. The patient as well as their family members should join groups where patients suffering from the disorder get together to discuss and exchange their experiences. Sharing views can help to a great extent, especially in determining the strategies to manage the disorder.


Doctor shopping

Those with Illness Anxiety Disorder are also said to be involved in a behaviour pattern termed as 'Doctor Shopping'. Megha says, ""Illness Anxiety Disorder patients are often involved in 'Doctor Shopping', i.e. visiting multiple healthcare professionals in the hopes to find an answer for the physical symptoms. These patients find it difficult to trust the doctors' diagnosis and thus go from doctor to doctor, hoping to have their assumptions confirmed by one or the other doctor."""

"Created: Jan 21, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,TV,I don’t think I deserved to be eliminated: Kishen Bilagali,"Dancer Kishen Bilagali has been one of the most popular contestants of Bigg Boss Kannada season seven, so much so that his elimination from the house has caused a stir on social media. The entire weekend saw #BringBackKishen trend and Kishen himself believes that he did not deserve to be eliminated from the show. Excerpts from a chat with him... Everyone seems to be upset about your elimination. What’s on your mind?
The elimination was a complete shock. I think I was one of the most deserving participants on the show, which I knew when I went into the house. Once I came out, it struck me even more, because of social media. I don't know if I deserved to be the winner, but I could have definitely stayed on longer and put up a fight. I have given tough competition to everyone in the house. So, when my ouster was announced, I was shocked, more so because I performed like a star and was even crowned the best performer. I am still unsure what happened and why I was eliminated.
You went into the house along with many popular faces with established fan followings. What did you tell yourself then that kept you inside for such a long time?

When I entered the house, I was very unwell. During the first few weeks of the show, I was even admitted to hospital for a day because of severe jaundice. This was how my fight started in the house. But from day one, seeing all the big stars, I just wanted to be myself. I wanted to project myself in the best way, be it in the way I dressed or the way I looked, everything was planned. I didn’t want to be like anything that was previously seen on a show like this. Yes, there were big names from television there, but I wanted to give them something that was never seen before. I believe I have done that with flying colours.
You were quite the ladies’ man on the show... I don’t know if that’s a talent. I used to sing ‘Hudugire Nan Weaknessu’ in the house. It has backfired too. But I would say that it wasn’t just the girls. I am generally a sweet, caring and loving person. I think that was one of the highlights for me. Since I like clothing and styling, I used to help the girls dress right and would suggest looks and hairstyles. It worked in building a rapport over a period of time.
Your friendship with Deepika Das has raised eyebrows. What’s happening there?
There’s nothing cooking there. We’re just two good friends. We don’t have that kind of an emotion for each other. I don’t think there would be anything like that. We were two similar souls and our wavelengths matched a lot of time, especially in the way we deal with people. This helped build a strong bond between us.
On the show, you spoke about being physically abused earlier. It must have been daunting to open up...

It took a lot of courage for me to speak about that. I never thought that I’d be able to talk about it in front of so many people. I was really happy. In fact, I kind of felt a little free deep inside. I’d always imagined people asking a lot of questions if and when I spoke about it, as it was disturbing. In the house, though, everyone was very sensitive about it and didn’t ask me uncomfortable questions.

Now that you’re out, what’s on your mind next?

I have nothing on my mind. I love acting and really want to get started on that front. Dancing will always remain my passion. I am kind of an open book and am going to leave it open to see what comes my way and accept the same with a lot of passion.

Who do you think will win the show?

I don’t know who will make it to the final week, but I’d personally be happy if Shine (Shetty) wins the show. I find him to be a very genuine soul. Apart from that, I also see Deepika as a strong contender for the final week.

Will you watch all the shows of the season, now that you’re out?

I’m not sure. I’m still disturbed after the elimination, as it was unexpected to both the audience and me."

Said to be a gangster film, the project will go on floors from the first week of March.

“When we were working on A1, we had decided that we would do another film soon. Once I got the one-liner, I developed it into a script. Santhanam liked it and here we are, back together,” he says.


“It’s about who will take over the mantle from an ageing Malaysian don. Santhanam plays a gangster from north Madras in the film. He has lost a lot of weight for the role and is now working on getting an athletic physique to play a young don. I’m from north Madras and I’ll be helping him with the slang,” says Johnson, “We are looking for a heroine who can pull off stunts convincingly.

The makers tried to explore my character further, but I was not keen on continuing.”

Meanwhile, Sangita denies being aware of any replacement. She shares, “My character’s track will have a proper ending, so it is not clear if they will replace me with another antagonist.

Don’t mug up; understand concepts: Aditi Prabhudeva

An engineer who also holds an MBA degree, actress Aditi Prabhudeva, says, “In my early engineering days, I didn’t realise how important marks would be as a stepping stone for an MBA and so, those semesters reflected that callousness. But once it struck me, my marks improved and so did my attitude towards examinations. It’s a different case that after completing these courses, I turned to acting. The moment I stopped learning my answers by heart while prepping to actually understanding the subjects, the fear of doing badly in my exams also faded away. Try to relax while learning, as a calm mind grabs concepts faster.”


Time management is important: Ambi Subramaniam Violinist and composer Ambi Subramaniam says that his biggest learning back then was to manage his time well, given that he had a hectic schedule as a musician as well. The musician who did a Bachelors in Business Management (BBM), followed by an MBA in Finance, says. “I remember this one time, when the semester exam schedule had a test every alternate day. I also had a very important concert in Chennai on one of the in-between days. I really learnt the value of time on that trip, as I took a flight right after the first exam, landed in Chennai, performed at the concert, studied my way back on the night flight home and then gave another exam the very next day,” he says.


Group studies help: Nishvika Naidu

Actress Nishvika Naidu says that her secret to securing good grades were to get her friends together for group study sessions. The actress, a Mount Carmel College alumnus, says, “I was a very restless kid, and wouldn’t study very well when I was alone. Group studies with my friends gave me a different approach to boring subjects;

discussions on the topics helped me retain that knowledge. It turned out that I would remember things better when they were discussed out loud in my study circle. The person in our group who was stronger than the rest in a particular subject, would host the session and impart whatever she knew on all the topics and that’s how we’d ensure that all of us do well in our examinations.”"

"Updated: Feb 19, 2020, 15:16 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,Demand for the film city project to remain in Mysuru gains momentum,"It appears that the uncertainty about a film city in Karnataka will continue for a while, what with both Bengaluru and Mysuru claiming stake to it. In 2016, the then state government had allotted 110 acres of land for the construction of the film city at Himmavu village, under a Public-Private partnership model, in association with the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy. Mysuru was the choice back then, as the city has nearly 100 shooting locations in a radius of 15-20 kilometres. Over the years, though, there has been no other development on this front and then, in 2019, there were rumours about a film city to be developed in Bengaluru. The buzz about it coming up at the Roerich estate on Kanakpura Road died as quickly as it came owing to opposition from environmentalists. But then, Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayana recently announced that a new location near Bengaluru had been identified to develop a film city, which would be on par with global standards.

Stakeholders, though, are far from happy with this turn of events. Kannada filmmaker director SV Rajendra Singh Babu, says, “The late Vishnuvardhan wanted the film city to be in Mysuru because of the city’s association with Kannada cinema.” Associate film director Chandan Kumar adds, “Bengaluru is already burdened with IT sector and other industries. It is time to start decongesting Bengaluru by having film city in Mysuru,” he says."
"Created: Jan 21, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,"Bengaluru students tell us how to sport coloured hair on campus, and get away with it","Yeah… when in college, one has to follow a dress code. But do these rules apply to the colours you sport on your hair? Bengaluru’s college students, especially the young ladies, tell us that the way they style their hair is all about self-expression, and the bright hues in them is even ‘artistic’ to an extent. And when there is trouble in the offing (read: teachers looking to pull you up for that splash of ‘distraction’ on your hair) these students tell us how to get away with having the cake and eating it too.

‘Make that colourful transformation at home’

Firstly, getting your hair coloured at the parlour is an expensive business. And to have your teacher reprimand you for those lovely coloured locks just when you are showing them off on campus, is a bummer. “Buying hair colour off the shelf and indulging in a DIY process at home is way cheaper. What’s more, you can even use the mix more than once, or even experiment with different shades of colours to bring out an all new colour,” says Niriksha Muralidhar, a student of Jain (deemed-to-be) University — Centre for Management Studies. If you do get caught, you at least won’t have that elaborate amount that you would have otherwise paid at the parlour distressing you to no end.


‘Colour a few strands or just the tips of your tresses to begin with’ The city’s students tell us that most teachers stay out of your hair as long as you have not made a spectacle out of yourself. “Brighter colours draw attention. In case you want it bright, opt to colour just a couple of strands of your hair or only the tips as that when you are at campus, you can do up your hair in such a way that the coloured bits are not visible. I usually tie my hair in a bun or make sure that only the side, which is not coloured is seen,” says Vanessa George, a student at Mount Carmel College. “Use accessories, like a scarf or skull caps to avoid attention if your campus has a strict dress code,” advises Niriksha.


Here are some tips on the art of hair colouring by the student experts


Experiment colouring on a strand of your hair before attempted to change your entire look
Always mix the colour with conditioner, as this avoids dryness of hair
Do not bleach your hair on your own, as this can go horribly wrong. If not bleached properly, your hair may break and fall off in lumps
Once you have coloured your hair, oil it regularly and use healthy and natural hair mask occasionally
Use colour protecting shampoo and conditioners, so that the colour doesn’t run off easily

The artistes, who took the stage together, could not stop raving about each other. And the camaraderie continued off the stage too. “We presented our individual sets, and then performed together on stage. Although we both practise different genres of music, to be able to present a combined act turned out to be an interesting experience. Such was the energy that the crowd also enjoyed the show a lot,” says Aneesh.


Describing it as a proud moment, Chandan says, “To see audiences dancing to Kannada music in Canada was pure joy. Our show was well-received and appreciated.” After the performance, Aneesh and Chandan indulged in some local cuisine and explored the city. “We walked around a little and spent time in each other’s company, talking about our love for music,” says Aneesh. Adding to this, Chandan says, “The conversations mainly revolved around looking at possibilities to widen our audience base.” So, does that hint at a collaboration soon? “I don’t know. It might happen. We did speak about it. But since we follow different styles, we have to work on it and see how we can take this forward,” Chandan sums up."

"Created: Jan 21, 2020, 00:01 IST",Prathibha Joy,Entertainment,Darling Krishna talks about turning director and producer with Love Mocktail,"Directing a film, says actor Krishna, has always been something that he wanted to do at some stage. He did, after all, begin his filmi journey as an assistant director, who later made the transition to acting. Better known as Madarangi Krishna or Darling Krishna, based on the film (and a song from it) that gave him a good break and got audiences to take note of him, the actor is now ready to present his first directorial venture, Love Mocktail. The film, he says, is very special to him, as he has donned multiple hats for it — he has done the script, screenplay, stunt-and-song choreography, direction and production. But the decision to make his own film, says Krishna, came only after a string of failures as a leading man. “After a few flops, I was looking at a dead end. It seemed like I had no way forward. I knew I had to do something, as I don’t know anything besides cinema,” he says. “I had always wanted to make quality Kannada cinema, so when I had a concept, I could have handed it to another filmmaker to do. But I decided to turn director and producer, and one of the very few who supported me was Kichcha Sudeep. He told me that instead of having some filmmaker make a hit or flop of it, I should take that chance myself,” says Krishna, adding that the film was about reinventing himself.

The idea for the film, he adds, came to him during a car journey from Bidadi to Mysuru. “I ran these by Milana (Nagaraj), who has been a close friend since our Nam Duniya Nam Style days, and she also thought they were interesting. Over the next 15-20 days, I had my script and screenplay in place and was ready to go on floors. At the time, though, all I had was `1 lakh in my bank account, but then Milana, who is also one of the leads in the film, decided to co-produce with me. From channeling our remuneration from other films into Love Mocktail, to doing multiple jobs on set, we managed to make do. For instance, there is no stunt or dance master on the rolls, as I choreographed the songs and the action sequences myself. We had no art director either, as we shot in real locations and all the props required for the shoots were sourced by me and Milana. In fact, we even did our own makeup, while Milana helped out the other two heroines — Amrutha Iyengar and newbie Rachana. Since I was also directing, after every shot, Milana would chip in as production executive and make sure everything was working well on the set, while I planned the next scene,” explains Krishna.

Love Mocktail, as the title suggests, is a story that follows multiple romances. “The film follows the journey of the hero from his teenage years to his late 30s and the women he encounters over the years. There are four love stories in the narrative, so the title seemed apt,” adds the debutant filmmaker.

The fact that they worked on a tight budget means that the focus was on good story telling than a lot of pomp and show. “For me, Love Mocktail is not a film, it is an experience,” he signs off."

In the latest episode of Bigg Boss 13, Sidharth and Shehnaz discuss to change the bed.
But Shehnaz tells Sidharth that she has no problem and doesn’t want to switch the bed. Sidharth shows no response. Shehnaz now goes on poking asking him reasons and why he ignores her. Sidharth tells her not to irritate.


Shehnaz doesn’t stop here and goes on asking him how dare he tell her to change the bed. Sidharth tells her that he is not comfortable and he said it clearly with his mouth. He goes on to add, “All this while I have been ignoring you thinking it to be your cuteness. But I am serious and you need to understand.”

Shehnaz tells him that she is not joking either. Sidharth explains to her elaborately, “See Shehnaz I know I am attached to you. But people like you are not in my circle. I can’t have people like you in my life. I don’t like people like you. You are not kiddish and I am not going to tolerate you anymore. What you are doing is not good and you will have problem.”


Shehnaz says he can’t break a relationship and something must have triggered him to react like this. She also goes on to say that he should accept her feelings that she is so attached to him. She says, “I feel ashamed to have attempted to hurt myself because of you. I am not doing this for the game.”


Sidharth finishes it off saying, “You are good. I am bad. Please stay away from me.”"

Mitali, who moved to Mumbai for her career, has even done a special appearance in Dear Zindagi. “That was a one-off role, I’m not doing cinema again,” she has maintained.

"Created: Jan 22, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Mohan Raja and I spent two days with Sriram Raghavan to discuss Andhadhun: Thiagarajan,"The Tamil remake of the Hindi film Andhadhun, which stars Prashanth in the lead, has a director on board! The film will be helmed by Mohan Raja, and the filmmaker has already completed the scripting work. Confirming the news, Thiagarajan, who’s acquired the remake rights, says, “A lot of reports about who would direct the film were making the rounds. But we had approached only Mohan Raja. The pre-production work is almost over, and the film will go on floors in February. Raja and I went to Mumbai last week and sat with Sriram Raghavan (director of Andhadhun) for two days to discuss the film. We spoke to him about what he thought he could have done differently after the film released, about certain scenes, what he did why he did... He spent three hours on the first day and five hours the next day with us. He was happy that the film was being made in Tamil. In fact, it was only recently that I told Sriram I’d remade his Johnny Gaddar as Johnny with Prashanth. He is a south Indian and speaks good Tamil.”

Ask him if he approached Raja because he’s successfully handled remakes before, and the actor-director-producer retorts, “No, not at all. Raja is a commercially successful director. All his films have resonated with the audiences, and he can handle all kinds of scripts. His Thani Oruvan and Velaikkaran, which did really well and won critical acclaim, were his own scripts. We chose him because he can do justice to the kind of sensibilities that Andhadhun reflects. In fact, we were worried he might not want to do a remake as he’s planning to make a pan-India film in three-four languages.”


Andhadhun, starring Ayushmann Khurrana, Tabu and Radhika Apte, won multiple National Awards. “It was also screened in countries like China, Korea and Japan and was loved by audiences the world over. So, I want to do justice to the remake,” says Thiagarajan, who is confident that Prashanth is an apt fit to play the lead. “Prashanth has completed four stages of piano in Trinity College. He’s been practising piano for the last six months. He’s lost a whopping 22 kilos and has gone to Malaysia to train more and reduce another five kilos,” he says. The rest of the cast and technical team is yet to be finalised. “Amit Trivedi’s compositions are the soul of the film. So, we are looking at locking a composer who can create that kind of magic. We should be announcing the rest of the cast soon,” he signs off."
"Created: Jan 22, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,TV,Raksh is Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man on TV 2019,"If television saw a comeback of sorts in 2019, it was of Raksh, who returned to the small screen with the TV show Gattimela. While his earlier stint in the show Puttagowri Maduve made him a face to watch out for, the new show seems to have sealed a place for him in the hearts of Kannada television viewers… so much so that he tops our list of Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man on TV, 2019. You have said that 2019 was a special year. Now, you have this title too...
It is honestly overwhelming. It is a big boost when you’ve been putting in a lot of hard work and something like this comes your way. It only encourages you to work harder. People may say hard work is what is needed and results don’t matter, but I say that they do. It took me some time to come here. Now that I have got here, I feel blessed.
Tell us about your journey in television...

I have my roots in theatre, and television was never part of my plan. My mind was set on films. I signed up for two films, which didn’t take off. That’s when I decided to give television a shot. It was only after I started that I realised how big the medium was. In just two years after I signed up for Puttagowri Maduve, I was already so close to achieving my dream — of being able to reach out to people. But then, Puttagowri Maduve was a female-centric one and did not give me the opportunity to really showcase my talent as much as I hoped for. I got that break with Gattimela, which set sail last year. I had only requested the makers to ensure that the character that was etched out stayed put and to leave the rest to me. They did that, and soon enough, the show began to get good viewer ratings. If Puttagowri Maduve paved the way to pursue my passion, Gattimela allowed me to showcase what I am really capable of.
Fans and social media form a big part of showbiz. How do you connect with them? I do take time out to reply to each of the messages that I receive on social media. It is interesting to see how audiences react to each character you play onscreen. In my earlier show, my character had shades of grey, but people now love the new character I have been playing.
What do you find desirable in a person?
To be called a desirable actor, one needs to have the ability to act effortlessly and consistently.
Who are the people you have desired to be like?

I look up to Yash. He began as an actor on the small screen and has grown to be a star who is known nationally. My childhood idol, though, has always been Shah Rukh Khan. My study room was filled with his posters. He has influenced generations of actors, including me.

You pursued law in college, how did that figure in your scheme of things?

I come from a family filled with engineers and doctors. I tried to follow suit, and took up science initially. But during graduation, I decided to pursue what I felt I had the aptitude for. My goal was to ensure I had a good educational background. Though I have not pursued law as a career, the various moot court sessions and ability to understand case studies has helped me understand the world better.

Looking good is important in showbiz. What has been your mantra?

I am a foodie and I love non-vegetarian food. During college, I would easily eat two plates of biryanis at one sitting. Over the years, I have learnt to control these urges. It is important for an actor to be disciplined, look good and maintain your physique. Being part of TV, this is a requirement right through the year, as we do not really have gaps between schedules during which you could afford to let go or relax. If you tend to slack here, people will overtake you in a moment.

And looking good comes with female admiration. Any interesting anecdotes...

I am yet to meet that crazy female fan who gives me that unforgettable story. But, yes, there have been many requests for selfies. Since my wife Anusha prefers to maintain a low profile, I have had female fans telling me that they love me after clicking that selfie, without realising that my wife is right next to me."

The actor will be seen as a Sri Lankan Tamil in a film directed by Seenu Ramasamy.

“I was supposed to be launched by Seenu Ramasamy sir. But, the project did not take off due to various reasons and I debuted with Susienthiran sir’s Champion. And now, I’m happy to get a second chance to work with Seenu sir,” Vishwa tells us, “I play a Sri Lankan youngster who migrates to Chennai for work. How his life changes after he meets and falls in love with a girl who works in a spa here is what the film will explore. It will be an entertainer, but steeped in reality. It will be a typical Seenu Ramasamy film, like his Neerparavai and Thenmerku Paruvakatru that won awards.”


Interestingly, the film was first announced as Spa, with Mollywood actor Shane Nigam playing the lead. “His dates didn’t work out and I’m doing the film now. Also, the film will not be titled Spa,” informs Vishwa.

The actor is presently taking diction lessons for his role. “I’m learning Sri Lankan Tamil from a coach in Tiruvannamalai now. Seenu sir’s busy with Maamanithan, which has Vijay Sethupathi in the lead. So, we should start pre-production soon after it releases in the next two months. We are looking at shooting this film from March,” Vishwa adds."
,"Created: Jan 22, 2020, 00:00 IST",-,‘Indrajith was willing to push himself for his character in Aaha’,"The team of the upcoming sports-drama Aaha, which revolves around tug of war, seems to have pulled out all the stops for the movie. While its director Bibin Paul Samuel and scriptwriter Tobit Chirayath have worked on the script for over four years, the cast too had allotted time and effort to be physically ready for the movie.

Bibin, who had wrapped up the film’s production on Monday, tells us, “It was an enjoyable and yet gruelling experience for all of us. We had actors who never had undergone physical fitness routine show up and put in close to four months of training to improve their strength to do the movie. By the end of it, all their palms were bruised and full of calluses.”


The film’s lead role is played by Indrajith, who will be seen in two get-ups in the movie as a 30-year-old and a 55-year-old. On casting him, Bibin says, “This project is a sports-drama and while casting for lead actors now, people look for actors who have market value. Indraettan’s solo movies might not have fetched those yet but I was confident that he was perfect for our character. Once we started working, it was clear that we put our money on the right horse. He was willing to push himself for the role and performed remarkable while playing a spirited tug-of-war leader and also as a depressed man in the 50s who returns as a coach.”

Physically too, Bibin says the actor had put in the effort to play the two phases of the character. “If we had more time, I am sure Indraettan would have been able to bring about a remarkable transformation for the character,” he says, adding that the original Aaha Neeloor’s team captain Roy Neeloor had been on the sets to help with the team’s preparations for the sport.


The team is currently looking for a Vishu release for the movie, which also has Ashwin K Kumar, Amith Chakalakkal and Santhy Balachandran in pivotal roles."

Anurag says, “Nandini and I have been living together since four years, after I proposed to her in February 2016. A few months ago, we felt that it was the right time to tie the knot and decided on the date. I think it’s a good idea to have a live-in relationship before getting married because that helps two people to know each other better.” Talking about Nandini, he says, “I am a quiet person. She is vivacious and completely opposite to me. I guess that’s what attracted me to her. We lived in the same area and used to bump into each other, and one day, I asked if she would come along with me to Siddhivinayak temple. So, that’s how it all began.”"
"Created: Jan 22, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Lifestyle,"Ravindra Jadeja is the apt ‘Mamba’ today, he strikes out of nowhere: Jonty Rhodes","During his most recent visit to Bengaluru for the Global Sports Injury Conclave, former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes was in the mood to talk about a topic that has caught his fancy lately — Bollywood. While Gully Boy is apparently the first film he has “watched properly”, he spoke to us about films and even gave us a glimpse of what it is like to be the fielding coach for cricket teams year after year. Excerpts:
In your time, you were nicknamed the mamba, after the snake, given how swift you were with your fielding. Who befits that title today?

I would probably pick Ravindra Jadeja. He is like a python, he strikes from nowhere. You don’t see him coming, and he runs effortlessly. If it is someone like me or even Suresh Raina, you can see us putting an effort; getting dirty, diving everywhere — but Jadeja doesn’t even look like he is raising a sweat. He doesn’t miss stumps and is so quick that he doesn’t have to dive. He is a phenomenal fielder for India. Manish Pandey is also great — he’s taken great catches in the boundary.
Young commentators often talk about the time players spend in the gym and of good core strength, but on the field, every part of your body is working. It is good see that young Indian players are learning the importance of fielding and building their skills. For a long time, players were hesitant to give it their all because the state of some of the stadiums is worrisome. If you dive half-hearted, you are more prone to injury than you would be if you are fully committed.
You recently tweeted that you watched Gully Boy and expressed your love for the film...

Actually, I am very embarrassed to say that Gully Boy is the first Bollywood movie I have watched properly despite my long association with the country. On an earlier occasion, I had watched a part of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. I was part of the Mumbai IPL team then, and we were playing a match in Ahmedabad. Harbhajan Singh was with us, and he took us to his friend’s movie theatre — it was a compact screening theatre with 20 seats and half the squad came. However, there were no subtitles. So, by the intermission, Harbhajan told me, that I could go and that he didn’t expect me to stay on (chuckles).

What I couldn’t understand in Bollywood was how in the middle of the movie, there was a song and a dance, and then they would immediately go back to fighting and punching each other. In that sense, Gully Boy was an easier acceptance. It is a song about music, dance and poetry woven into the movie. When I met Siddhant Chaturvedi (who plays MC Sher in the movie), a year ago, I heard the songs, and had not watched the movie. And I had really enjoyed it. I do believe that I haven’t done enough justice to discovering Bollywood. There has been more ignorance on my part, but I really, really enjoyed watching this movie.


When coaching, while having to deal with players' injuries on the field, has there ever been clumsiness off the field that has led to players hurting themselves?

Strangely, getting on and off buses that take you to and from the stadium or airport, involves a bit of jostling around. For instance, when Sachin Tendulkar was playing for the Mumbai IPL team, a lot of effort would go into ensuring the crowd around was cleared before we could get the players on and off the bus. But other than that, decent cricket players have fairly good coordination. There are some clumsy guys, but fortunately, there have been no instances of slipping in the bathroom and falling over, or anything of that sort.


Is there one thing that is most challenging about being a coach?

Very often. After an entire season of coaching during a tournament, we then meet 10 months later at the start of a new season. But at that point, we have to start all over again, because the intensity of training during this gap has not been the same. Cricket is a game of habit, so we need to get to the basics and emphasise, to coaches and players alike, that maintaining one’s training intensity through the year is important. This is a message I have been trying to impart to players at the grass root level too."

Their tussle leads to an ugly fight and Bigg Boss intervenes in between.

They are summoned to the confession. Sidharth and Asim are first asked to behave like adults since just a few weeks are left. Bigg Boss is not happy to have called them twice in the room and warns them of severe consequences.


Then Bigg Boss orders Asim to be in the Elite Club and Sidharth in the bedroom till the next announcement. Asim leaves the confession room and Sidharth stays back. Sidharth asks, ‘What if I beat him up, what would be the consequences?’ Bigg Boss tells him not to take any such step which he will regret later.

Asim doesn’t go to the elite club and waits outside. As Sidharth gets to speak to Bigg Boss, Asim too, wants a chance. He comes inside and tells Bigg Boss that Sidharth needs anger management class and ‘serious counselling’. Bigg Boss annoyingly tells him nobody has asked for his suggestion and he is no one to tell what Bigg Boss needs to do.


He reprimands Asim for not listening to his orders and staying back. Bigg Boss repeatedly tells Asim to go and sit in the Elite Club. Sidharth loses his cool and looks extremely frustrated. He also expresses his wish to quit the show. During his conversation with Bigg Boss Sidharth looks quite frustrated and says he is not mad to behave in such a way. He says, 'It looks like I am mad. I am not mad. If somebody sets a bar, I always raise it be it for good or bad."" Bigg Boss advises him to ignore Asim completely and not talk to him at all."

The day began with a race of the Indian bread horses in which Khula Tara won the first race making his owner Nafeesh ecstatic. The racing enthusiasts were also delighted to witness a vintage car rally after the race. People watched the vintage beauties on wheels glide past with their proud owners driving them. Sandeep Narain, owner of Fiat Spider, 1958, said, “My car was designed by Pininfarina, who later designed models for Ferrari. I had to almost dig this car out of a farmhouse in Delhi. When I saw it, only the top part of the car was visible, the rest was completely immersed in mud and dirt. It took me about four years to completely restore this car, assembling various parts from across the country and outside.”

Post the vintage car rally, another horse race consisting of thoroughbred horses was organised in which Vijoy’s Joy owned by Amar Habibullah and Mohit Bhargava clinched the top spot. While soulful music played in the background, prizes were presented by Chief Guest Major General Pravesh Puri and wife Hemi.

Neon paint, glow stick and music — these ingredients added an interesting dimension to the yoga session. “It’s meant to be fun,” says yoga teacher, Jenil Dholakia. “The purpose is to do something unique with yoga. People wore white or neon, which glowed under the special lights. They even got phosphorescent body paint designs, like painted bangles. It was a spiritual party with a lot of movement, breathing and mindfulness. You could perform the moves freely as nobody was watching you.” The format involved playing peppy music. And Mumbaikars loved it.


Glow with the flow




Says Andheri-based resident Rita Baveja, “I tried this yoga variation for the first time. We did downward dog, tree pose, sun salutations, etc in the dark.” Swati Mishra, who was part of the workout, found the whole experience ‘different’. “It’s a fitness regimen you can take up to break the monotony of your usual workout,” she says, adding, “It is also a great way to reduce stress.”

Boon or bane? That debate can go on. But bringing out an entire drama production — from the initial talks to the final rehearsals — via a telecommunications app looks like a big plunge for the theatre world. And that’s the curious story behind the Bengaluru premiere of American author-playwright-director Jeff Baron’s globally popular play, Visiting Mr. Green — a comedy-drama that sifts through generations, religion, culture and sexuality. Written more than two decades ago, this award-winning piece has had over 500 productions in nearly 25 languages. India is the 50th nation to stage the play. The play will be staged at Ranga Shankara on February 1 (3.30 pm and 7.30 pm). In a telephonic conversation from New York, Jeff spoke to us about the Indian adaptation that features veteran theatre personality, MK Raina (as Mr Green), and actor Aakash Prabhakar (as Ross Gardiner), what he finds interesting about the Indian audience and more. Excerpts:

‘Speaking through computer screens seemed more intimate than meeting in person’

Ambitious as it may sound, the fact that I started working with Raina and Aakash through video calls, sitting in my New York City apartment, a few months before we met in person, was a huge leap of faith for all of us. Yes, technology has made the world a smaller place in many ways, but conducting rehearsals online was a unique experience. I eventually started working with music composer Prashanth Srinivas, set designer Vivek Jadhav, lighting designer Vikrant Thakar, stage manager Jaymin Thakkar, and assistant director Mallika Shah, as well. It felt like working with old friends and colleagues; a true meeting of the minds. I think virtual communication is the way forward, as it can open the door to more transcultural collaborations in theatre.

What makes Visiting Mr. Green a relevant watch in India today

Visiting Mr. Green, which runs for 1 hour and 35 minutes, is a cross-generational play that has resonated with people from different cultures. It is known to promote a certain sense of tolerance across national and societal borders. The narrative is basically a conversation between an 86-year-old widower and a 29-year-old corporate executive, who is ordered by the court to routinely visit the former, after the latter almost ran over him in a case of reckless driving. The play investigates our deep-seated religious differences, while also addressing questions of sexuality. As the tone of the script goes from comic to serious and back, the narrative keeps the focus on how people from different generations look at things differently. The play is partly autobiographical; it’s about real experiences. Thus, many find it quite relatable too. Plans are afoot to come up with a Hindi translation for the play, which will enable us to take the production to more towns and cities across the country. The play was earlier staged in Greece, Germany, Mexico, Israel, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Uruguay, among other nations.



‘There is an intellectual rigour in Indian theatre’

There is some really fine craftsmanship that I have noticed among playwrights and actors in India. There is an intellectual rigour which, I think, is exclusive to this country.

"Created: Jan 23, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,TV,Most Desirable Woman on TV 2019: Anushree,"She’s sassy, spunky and has her way with words. So, it’s no wonder, really, that Anushree has literally unparalleled fanfare that propelled her to become the first Kannada TV celebrity with over one million followers on Instagram. This popularity, it seems, has worked for her, as she wins the Bangalore Times Most Desirable Woman on TV 2019 title, hands down. Excerpts from a chat... Most Desirable... What does that tag mean to you?
This is a magical moment for me. It was like expecting the unexpected. The work I do has evoked mixed emotions among people with some liking me and others disliking me. But when I got to know that I am the most desirable woman on television, everything seemed magical. Now, I want to enjoy the next 365 days until the next list is out. Thank you Bangalore Times followers and my fans for helping me get this tag.
Your journey to becoming the most desirable woman has been quite eventful...

It was, no doubt, a challenging journey. It wasn’t easy. I’m sure any person’s career journey is often far from easy. But that journey becomes interesting only when you have those challenges. If your path is a smooth-sailing road, then it would be boring. My journey has had a lot of roadblocks and speed-breakers along the way. But I’ve persevered and come through victorious.
A close look at Kannada TV shows just how much anchoring has changed. In fact, your signature style has won a lot of fans... I would really thank Akul Balaji for this change. I’ve been hosting shows for a decade, but people really started taking note of me only about five years ago, when I was the host of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. I have probably done hundreds of shows before that, but it was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa that made ‘anchor Anushree’. Akul has to be credited for anchors being taken seriously and considered stars too. He got people to notice how shows without anchors are like buses without drivers. Now, shows are being created keeping anchors in mind too, unlike earlier, when they were an afterthought. Also, if you notice, show hosts are now allowed to be themselves and showcase their personality while anchoring, which is in stark contrast to earlier when it was mandatory to be all formal and speak bookish, chaste Kannada.

Being in the limelight also means curating looks. How much effort do you put into that?

I do give a lot of thought to my look. Personally, I think I am badly dressed when I am not at work. You will not see me in coordinated outfits. In fact, I hate dressing up. But I know that I have to put in an effort and be presentable when I am on television or hosting live shows. The head of the channel that I am associated with thinks that I am a favourite with family audiences, who consider me like one of their own — a daughter, perhaps. So, he keeps telling me that I have to maintain that family-friendly look. This means that I cannot wear torn jeans for TV, as families are watching me. I really want to meet those families (laughs). Despite my modest outfits, I often get compliments. So, when deciding my look, I give extra thought to the colours and ensure that my outfits allow me to move around freely, as I hate being stationary in one place.

What according to you is desirable? What do you think is desirable in you?

That’s a tricky question. Everyone desires something and that keeps changing. As for me, I think people might have chosen me not only for my anchoring, but for the person that I am. Many people walk up to me and tell me how inspirational I have been to them. They applaud my career-driven attitude, which makes me want to desire more.

Who is desirable according you?

I really like Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Even without a background in showbiz, she went on to become Miss World and then went on to do well in Bollywood and carve a niche for herself in Hollywood too. She’s so multi-talented. If I had to emulate someone, it would definitely be Priyanka."

What’s interesting is that he has to put on an additional 20kg for his role in the film. “Yes, I play a chef who weighs 100kg in the film. There is a connection to my weight and the storyline and I have put on 20kg for the role.

The film, a romantic comedy, is set in London. “At present, we are in London shooting for the movie. Ani and I did a short film titled Maya, which got international recognition. He is also the writer of Marakkar. We were discussing this film for some time now and we are happy that the shooting is on.

They used to be active in thinnai drama. Later, KB came to Chennai and he worked for the AG’s office. My father joined the Life Insurance Corporation and was posted in Madurai.

By 70s, KB completely moved to the big screen. Even though my father came to Chennai in 1969 on KB’s insistence, he couldn’t pursue movies because of his ill-health. My father even asked me if I wanted him to introduce me to KB and work under him as an assistant director. But I didn’t show much interest then.”
Sreeram says that it was after he happened to read something that his father had written in his diary, that his life changed. “I didn’t pursue art even though I realised my artistic skills at a very young age. I was a part of NCC and pursued boxing and karate for a while. I dreamt of joining the armed forces. But I ended up in sales. My father had a habit of writing diaries. As I was going through one of them during a usual drinking session in a hotel room after work, my eyes fell on a notation across one of the pages, ‘Oru kai thukivecha yogimathiri en vazhkai ayidichu’, which meant that if you don’t use your skills for a long time it will wean away. Though I was drunk, it pricked my conscience. He gave me education and economic stability. And more than anything else, I imbibed artistic skills from him. The next day morning, I wrote my resignation letter.”

So, in 1989, Sreeram says, he decided to dabble in art. “Though the salary was less as compared to my previous job, I joined a small ad agency. My wife was supportive. She said, ‘Pursue whatever you want as long as we don’t have debts’. Initially, I’d draw logos with hand and reproduce them at some DTP centre. Slowly, I got used to computers. I chose advertising to start with as it helped me merge my sales knowledge and artistic skills. It was a good move; there was no looking back.”

How did Krav Maga happen? “I was around 45 — I felt I had to be a bit more serious about my health. But I was sure I wouldn’t enjoy working out in a gym. And that’s when I stumbled upon Krav Maga. It appeared more fluid and pragmatic when compared to traditional martial arts. At that time, there were these Israeli instructors of the art who had come to Delhi for a workshop — I attended two of their week-long courses. That introduced me to the fundamentals of Krav Maga. I completed three levels, and in a few years, started teaching on weekends and later, it became full-time affair.”

Later, he recalls, he got introduced to the present DGP of Chennai, JK Tripathy, and was asked to help with a presentation on Public Administration for an international conference. “And that’s how I started off as a consultant for presentations of the police. Now, I am a police instructor for Krav Maga,” says Sreeram.


“In the last few years,” Sreeram continues, “I have only been looking at doing Krav Maga sessions twice a day and some painting in between. But things have changed since Sillu Karupatti happened,” he admits.


So, how did he land this role? “One of my students, an aspiring actor, posted pics of some of our sessions on social media. This was in 2016. Then, Halitha, the director of Sillu Karupatti, was looking for an old man to play the male lead in one of the stories in the anthology. She called me and asked if I’d be willing for the role. I thought it would be like any other offer I had been offered earlier by filmmakers, but never materialised. But when I read the script, I realised that it was about 20 pages of romance (laughs). And finally, we shot for five days.”


How was it being in front of the camera for the first time? “I didn’t have major problems in acting. I have been a good communicator and have been on stage on many occasions. I would ask the director the mood that particular shot needed and then, go for the take. The challenge was in dubbing. After almost a year, I was called for dubbing. So, I had to go back in time and get into that same mood. That was a real challenge. I am not a voice artiste. But the director didn’t want to use a dubbing artiste. Since it was a love story about two older people, she didn’t want the audience to have any pre-conceived image about the protagonists.”


But ever since the film released, he has been getting friend requests from Ceylon, Maldives, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, he laughs. But what about friends and family? “My wife hasn’t seen the film yet because it’s all about romance. There’s a scene where I kiss the woman’s shadow. When someone says that particular scene was good, my wife is like, ‘Kiss panreya, nee?’ (laughs). It’s just that she can’t leave the grandchildren and go watch it. She’ll probably watch it when it comes on online platforms,” he signs off."

"Created: Jan 23, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,I stayed true to myself during my stay in Bigg Boss house: Chandan Achar,"Even though he was nominated for eviction almost every week during his stay in the Bigg Boss Kannada house, actor Chandan Achar not only persisted, but managed to hang on for over 90 days, which is a phenomenal feat. “I don’t fret over things that are not under my control. I was confident of winning the show, even though I was getting nominated every week. I thank people for having voted for me every time I was in the danger zone through these weeks. In my entire journey, I have stayed true to myself, which is the only reason I was able to survive in the house for more than 90 days,” he says.
In staying true to his self, Chandan gave the housemates and audiences a glimpse of his short temper as well, when he got into a spat with Raju Thalikote and Kuri Prathap. “I played the game fairly without any biases. I am the one who calls a spade a spade, which did not go down well with many members in the house. This is also why I was getting nominated so frequently. But having said that, my spat with Raju and Kuri was because of the situation. It was an emotional outburst. Most of contestants think I am short-tempered, but I don’t hold anything against any contestant in the house. Sometimes, the tasks make us behave a certain way, which may seem unacceptable,” he says.

The actor also managed to rub the ladies in the house the wrong way with some of his comments about their makeup regimes. “I said what I felt. The task required us to recall our experience from the first day in the house. On the morning after the first day, I couldn’t recognise most of the female inmates, as none of them had makeup on. I feel, as an artist, makeup has its own value, there is no need to cover our faces with makeup throughout the day. I made the comment on a lighter note, it wasn’t meant to hurt anyone,” he adds.

So, does he have any takeaways from the show? “It became really difficult to live with eight to 10 contestants in the house owing to differences in opinion. I have now learnt to respect the opinion of other people, but only if they are genuine. Even If I don’t respect opinions, I think there is no need to have hatred towards them,” says Chandan, who eventually ended up being more of a loner during his stint on the show.


Interestingly, enough, the actor says that he has favourite moments from the show. “I already miss Bigg Boss’ voice. The tasks taught me not to lose my temper in tough situations. Despite all differences, when festivals came, we celebrated together, which is what makes Bigg Boss a special journey in my life. I cherish the time I spent with Jai Jagdish, as there was so much to learn from his wealth of experience. Vasuki Vaibhav is from theatre background, so we connected well and Sujatha was a treasure trove of knowledge.”


On nominating Priyanka while being evicted from the show, Chandan adds that he believes she is losing herself to win the show. “She has to play the game in right spirit. There should be no room for any contestants to fake emotions in the house,” he says, adding that he considers Shine Shetty a strong contender to win the show. “Shine is a more balanced person in the house. He knows what needs to be done win the show. I wish him good luck.” he signs off."

The 2020 edition of this popular city event is dedicated to Swami Vivekananda. Apart from the floral installations, the event is also conducting horticultural competitions. Scheduled to go on till January 26, the flower show saw over 36,000 visitors during the first weekend. Commenting on the 211th chapter of the flower show, MR Chandrashekhar — Secretary of the Mysore Horticultural Society and Deputy Director of Horticulture, Lalbagh Botanical Garden — says, “It took more than two months to put up the entire floral arrangement.

This year, we have tried different installations, with the most popular one so far being the vertical garden that uses fences or trellis to
support the plants.”

Docus, books and flowers mark SWAMI Vivekananda’s legacy
This year’s show is a tribute to Swami Vivekananda on his 157th birth anniversary. From Belur Math to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, the Glasshouse is filled with floral replicas of these places, along with his statues.

"Created: Jan 23, 2020, 01:00 IST",Onkar Kulkarni,Entertainment,Shraddha Kapoor: The love that I get from smaller towns is special,"Shraddha Kapoor is back to dancing on the big screen with Street Dancer 3D. While she proved her mettle as a dancer with ABCD 2 (2015), this time around she is all set to raise the bar. In a conversation with BT, the actress spoke about the various new dance forms she learnt for the Remo D’Souza-directorial, working with co-star and childhood friend Varun Dhawan, her relationship status and more. Read on…
The audience has seen your dancing prowess in ABCD 2. How different is Street Dancer 3D from your previous dance film?
We have taken the dancing notches higher by introducing moves, which are a lot more challenging. The choreography that the team worked on is mind-blowing. It was quite a challenge as there were instances when we came up with impromptu moves. Among the new dance forms that I learnt for this film, I really enjoyed New School, Afro, Locking, Popping and Robotics. I just enjoy dancing. While growing up, I was floored by Madhuri’s (Dixit Nene) adaas. I also think Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Katrina Kaif are incredible dancers.

In the film, Nora Fatehi and you are a part of teams that are competing against each other. She is a fantastic dancer, were you worried about matching steps with her?
I know that Nora is a fantastic dancer. We shot a dance-off for the movie, and it was a lot of fun clashing with each other for the sequence. I am fond of great dancing and good dancers. Whenever I see great dance videos on social media, I make it a point to praise and encourage the dancers. In 2017, when Nora had barely stepped into the industry, I had commented on her dance video. However, I didn’t get a reply from her. My comment probably got lost in the many messages that she had received for it. When we met for the first time on the sets of this film, I told her about the incident. When I got to know that Nora would be a part of the film, I was super excited. I believed that if we had her on board, it would only make our team and our film stronger.
Though this is your second film with Varun Dhawan, you have known each other for many years. Has he changed over the years?
No, Varun hasn’t changed a bit. He is the same VD I have known for so many years. I like the way he bonds with people and the way he gels with his teammates on a film set. He is extremely friendly and approachable.

Varun recently mentioned that while growing up, he had a crush on you...
(Cuts in…) He had that kiddie crush on me. He thought that I didn’t know about it, but I knew back then that he had a crush on me.

In a recent interview with BT, Mohit Suri, who directed you in Aashiqui 2 (2013), said that he had reservations about casting you in Malang, since you are ‘India’s sweetheart’. Do you see this kind of an image as a shortcoming?
Mohit means a lot to me. If he is saying this, then I want to continue being that. I like being ‘India’s sweetheart’. The kind of love I get from smaller towns is extremely special. It can be in any form, like when you see your photo on the back of an autorickshaw, it makes you feel loved and admired. I just want this love to grow. As for being typecast, it is not something that I can decide. That depends on the audience. I keep doing films with different subjects and varied roles, be it Stree (2018), Chhichhore (2019) or Saaho (2019). In the end, it is all about how the audience reacts to the film.

You had started prepping for the Saina Nehwal biopic, but later, you left the project. What went wrong?
What happened is, I couldn’t say no to Remo sir. The dates of Street Dancer 3D were clashing with the sports biopic and I could either do this project or that film. So, I went ahead with a project that was helmed by someone who has given me a movie like ABCD 2. I was committed to the biopic, but finally, I had to opt out. That was quite unfortunate, and I wish it hadn’t happened. The training that I underwent for that film helped me better my performance in Street Dancer 3D. I became fitter, which helped me play the role of a dancer.

So, you picked a relationship over a film project?
Absolutely. There are a few people in the industry who I will stand for and cannot say no to. These people include Mohit and Remo sir, they mean so much to me. This is the second time that I am working with Remo sir. When someone gives you something special to be a part of, you will always be there for that person, in whatever way you can. So, when Remo sir offered me Street Dancer 3D, it was a no-brainer for me, I had to be a part of the film.


Your forthcoming film, Baaghi 3, marks your return to the franchise…

Yes, I am really looking forward to working with the team. Also, Tiger (Shroff) is so much fun to be around. We went to school together, so there is a certain comfort level in working with him. There is an entirely different side of his personality that I know of. He is shy around people who he doesn’t know very well, but he is a mastikhor around me. He comes up with these poker-faced one-liners, which I cannot share as they are often inappropriate (laughs!).


There is buzz that you are dating celebrity photographer Rohan Shrestha, and that the two of you are planning to tie the knot soon. Is that true?

Right now, I don’t have the time to think about anything apart from the movies that I am doing. And like you said, it’s only ‘buzz’ (laughs!)."

"Created: Jan 23, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Helly Shah to play the protagonist in the second season of 'Ishq Mein Marjawaan',"The makers of 'Ishq Mein Marjawaan', which featured Nia Sharma, Aalisha Panwar and Arjun Bijlani in key roles, are bringing the show back. While Vishal Vashishtha and Rrahul Sudhir have been finalised to play the two heroes, Helly Shah has been roped in to play the protagonist in the new show. Ask her if she feels any pressure to make this instalment more popular than the previous one and she replies, “Not at all. In fact, I am quite excited, as I always wanted to do a thriller show, and I am getting to do one with this. I will try my best to do justice to my character.”

Unlike last time, the heroine won’t be seen in a double role in the new show. This works well for Helly, who was in the news for her health woes during her stint in 'Sufiyana Pyaar Mera', in which she played a double role. The actress had then mentioned that playing twin roles is quite challenging. She says, “I don’t mind playing a double role again, but there is no such track in 'Ishq Mein Marjawaan' as of now. I got three months to focus on my health, which I couldn’t during the shoot of my previous show. I also travelled to Rajasthan and spent time in my hometown, Ahmedabad.”"
"Created: Jan 23, 2020, 01:00 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Jassie Gill: I don’t compete with my co-stars,"Punjabi singer-actor Jassie Gill, who will be seen as a railway employee Prashant in Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s Panga, was surrounded by strong co-actresses — Kangana Ranaut, Neena Gupta and Richa Chadha — in the film. In his first Bollywood outing, Happy Phir Bhag Jayegi (2018), he was one of the four guys leading the cast with Sonakshi Sinha as the central character.

When asked if he feared being overshadowed by his female co-stars during Panga, Jassie said, “I don’t compete with my co-stars, I just do my work and try to give it my best. I was cast in Panga even before my first Hindi film released. So, for me, even Panga is like my debut. As an actor, it doesn’t matter who is in the frame with me; I just focus on what I have to do in a scene. Like with Kangana, we used to sit down and read our scenes together before we started the shoot. Ashwiny ma’am would also explain everything to us. So, there was no need for me to feel outnumbered or overshadowed.”


In his previous interview to BT, Jassie had said that he had turned down films that didn’t promise to put him on the poster. After working in two films, does he think differently now? He replied, “I’ve worked as a lead actor in Punjabi films and didn’t want to do two-scene roles in Bollywood. I want to act in films that give me the scope to perform. I’m not obsessed with being on posters and I don’t ask for it now because it comes on its own.”"

Titled Humraah, the number has been penned by Kunaal Vermaa and sung by Sachet Tandon. The groovy track captures the sizzling chemistry between Disha Patani and Aditya Roy Kapur, the lead pair of the film, as they indulge in adventure sports like skydiving, subwing, kitesurfing and riding quad bikes.

Talking about the song, director Mohit Suri says, “Humraah is about living on the edge; without boundaries, for your own self. It’s about the conquest of fears by facing them. The song celebrates an unapologetically selfish attitude.”


A self-confessed water baby, Disha adds, “We shot this song in Mauritius. The place is so beautiful that the whole experience was great fun. I love water sports and before we commenced the shoot of the song, we trained in kitesurfing, cliff diving and scuba diving for about five days.”"

While his first two films, 'ABCD: Anybody Can Dance' (2013) and 'ABCD 2' (2015), were all about the art form on stage, this time around, he is taking it to the streets. He promises that this experiment of his called 'Street Dancer 3D' is going to be a joyride. In a chat with BT, he talks about casting stars in his film, box-office expectations and making one of India’s best dancers — Prabhudeva — dance to his tunes. Excerpts:
'Street Dancer 3D' is your third dance film. The challenge to make it bigger and better must have been daunting...
I feel that I have not explored even five per cent of the kind of dance and music that’s there in our country and across the world. While the earlier two films were based on dancing on stage, we have taken to the streets with this one. 'Street Dancer 3D' is based in London and revolves around Indian, Pakistani and people of other nationalities. It’s about desis, who are born and brought up there and the film focuses on what they feel about India. It is based on a documentary on illegal immigrants. There’s a strong storyline that sees a fusion with dance and music. When I make a dance film, I make sure that the characters have a reason to dance. It took some time to find that reason. But when we found it, it was amazing.

While song and dance have been an important aspect of Hindi films for many decades, there is a section that tends to look down on it, without realising the amount of hard work that goes into it...
A lot of people associate Bollywood with just song and dance. I get annoyed when they say that. Aise hi thodi hum duniya mein sabse zyada films banaate hain. Toh kabhi kabhi bura lagta hai, but I am glad that the perception is changing. Maybe, in the coming years, we will prove that the Indian film industry is the best. Bollywood is known for its music and dance, and there are no two ways about it. However, we are now making films without music and dance, too. But back when I decided to make a film on dance, there weren’t too many films of that genre. Everyone told me that this genre doesn’t work and that’s why no one makes any films that focus on dance. During the process, I realised that if I focus only on music and dance, without any story, it won't work. I knew that I needed a strong story to pull it off. A strong storyline is of paramount importance to support a dance film, and when you have that, you’ve got a winner.

With 'ABCD', you delivered a hit without a big star. Why did you feel the need to rope in Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor for the second instalment and repeat them in 'Street Dancer 3D'? Do you think star presence translates into box-office success?

The film industry doesn’t talk about hits and flops anymore. Now, it’s all about the box-office collection on the day of the release, the second day and weekends. Today, no one asks, ‘Picture kaisi hai?’ All they ask is the first-day collection of the film. As a filmmaker, it’s scary to answer questions about the collections instead of how a movie is made. A film is judged on that. While it is scary, this is how the industry works now, and so, numbers matter. When we started working on 'ABCD 2', I realised that the person playing the central character had to be a strong actor along with being a good dancer. That combination was tough to find. Our quest to find that perfect combination ended with Varun and Shraddha. When we met Shraddha for 'ABCD 2', she said that she would audition for the part even if she was not chosen for it. She did this despite being a big name in the industry. I appreciate her dedication and sincerity, and we cast her.


Katrina Kaif and not Shraddha was your original choice for 'Street Dancer 3D'. Did you make any changes to the script after Shraddha came on board?

The script was originally written keeping in mind that this would be the third instalment of 'ABCD'. But since the studio that backed the first two films had shut down its Hindi film production unit, I had to take the film to someone else. I couldn’t use the same title, and so, we named the film 'Street Dancer 3D'. Varun was the original choice for it along with Katrina. However, just a month before we were set to go on floors, she had to opt out of this film due to Bharat. Everyone knows what happened with that film… Priyanka Chopra (Jonas) backed out and Katrina had to step in. We were stuck because I couldn’t push my schedule, as I wanted to shoot during winter in London. Being a thorough professional, Katrina herself told us that we should go with somebody else. That’s when Shraddha came on board. I had to make very minute changes in the script when she joined the team. Having said that, it doesn’t mean that one is indispensable. It could have happened with the actor, too. If an actress can get replaced, so can the actor.


You are extremely fond of Prabhudeva, and he has featured in all your dance films. Since he is also a choreographer and director, does it ever get tricky for you to make him dance to your tunes?

Not at all. He is the sweetest person I have met in my life. Despite being a big director and actor, he behaves like a newcomer on the set and surrenders himself to the vision of the director. He has never read the scripts of the films I have offered him, nor has he ever inquired about his character. He just comes and asks, ‘What do you want me to do?’ That’s how much he trusts me. His favourite line is, ‘Don’t make me dance so much; you should consider my age. These youngsters are better dancers than me.’ But as soon as the music is turned on and he starts dancing, he puts everyone to shame. He is like family to me, and will be a part of every dance film that I make."

Touted to be one of the highest paid actresses on television today, ask her if the news is true and she says, “I was 13 when I started with Sapne Suhane... and now I am 20. And if there are articles about me being one of the highest paid actresses, I will not quote the amount, but I have actually worked really hard to reach where I am today. I have put in blood and sweat in everything that I have done. I started auditioning when I was just 9 years old. I gave hundreds of auditions and when things did not work out in my favour, I thought probably I am not made for acting. I have seen bad times. And even though I am earning a decent amount today, it has not got into my head. The profession in which I am has no stability. Take for example my last two shows Rishton Ka Chakravyuh and Mariam Khan – Reporting Live, which shut down after a few months only. If I am earning good for six months, I am not sure if I will be earning also in the next six months or not, and yes, as of now I am not the highest paid actress on television but I would love to be one,” says Mahima.

She adds, “I started off very young but that was out of choice and not out of any family pressure. I wanted to get into acting and start earning as well. Now I am taking care of my bank account as I have grown up. Even my mom is helping me manage my finances and we both are the raja-rani of our lives.”

She says, “I feel proud to have bought a house of my own in a city like Mumbai when I was just 15 though it was just one BHK. I now wish to buy a bigger flat of my own as my brother has recently got married. I just want to get settled in life and stay independent all my life.”

Not happy with the present scenario of shows going off air, Mahima shares, “It is very recently while giving an interview when asked if I miss my Sapne Suhane... days, I realised that more than missing the serial part, I miss the attention that the actors used to get then. There is so much of competition between TV shows and content on web that actors today do not get that much of attention. Also, there is no longevity of shows today which was there earlier. Sapne Suhane went on for three years when we were aiming for five years. But now as an actress I aim for a show to run for a year. I was really disappointed when Rishton Ka Chakravyuh was pulled off air mid-way. It was a great level show with great actors like Lubna Salim, Anju Mahendru Sangeeta Ghosh, and so many of them.”"

"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,"I may have missed out on opportunities by not attending parties, but I don’t regret that: Suniel Shetty","Bollywood actor Suniel Shetty was on a self-imposed break for a few years — a time well-spent with his father, whom he lost thereafter — until his recent comeback with the multilingual Pailwaan, alongside Kichcha Sudeep. His return to films has also heralded in a new phase in his career, as he branches out into other industries. He’s already done Darbar with superstar Rajinikanth and is part of Mohanlal’s Malayalam film Marakkar as well. Amid all this excitement, Suniel made a quick trip to Bengaluru to be a part of a sports injury conclave, during which we caught up with him for a quick chat on films, fitness and fashion, and also tells us why he thinks Bengaluru has changed. Excerpts…
Your children, Ahan Shetty and Athiya Shetty, have followed in your footsteps and forayed into the film industry. Does it fill you with a sense of pride?
I have been a proud father right from the day they began school. They were well-behaved, humble, respectful students. Mana (his wife) has brought them up beautifully. Ahan and Athiya grew up around their grandparents, and have learnt good values amid love and affection. What I am happy about is that they chose their careers and trained for it.

A lot of people had expressed their concern over girls being in films (referring to Athiya). But I believe that as long as you are brave and confident, you can handle anything in the world. I remember being asked at a press meet once, “The film industry is such a shady place. What advice do you give your daughter about it?” I replied, “I don’t give any advice to my daughter at all. Instead, I advise my son to treat women well.” If everyone does that, there is no cause for concern.
The Class of 80s south actors are famed for organising annual get-togethers that most aim to attend religiously. Is there a trend like that in Bollywood?
There is no such trend in Bollywood, but when a team is working together, there is a tendency to meet up. But I stay further away from the city, and the journey back home is long and tiring. Also, I am very lazy, so I often skip going to such get-togethers. Once my shoot is done, I head back home and spend time with my family. On Saturdays, I usually catch up with my childhood friends. I have some amazing friends in the industry as well. I meet them whenever there is time.

Do you feel that by not socialising much, you may have missed out on movie opportunities?
I may have missed out on a few opportunities by not attending parties, but I don’t regret that. Sometimes, you need to make a choice in life, and I choose family over anything else. In my career, there was a four-year period when I did not work, but those were also the most beautiful four years of my life, because I spent time with those whom I love the most. And during that time, the media did not forget me. When a certain movie has done well and you ask me how I feel, I would say that I am feeling good. But in a movie like Darbar, I know that it has done well mainly because of Rajinikanth sir. Similarly, Pailwaan was a big hit, and the credit for its success goes mainly to Kichcha (referring to Sudeep). I accept that. I think I am in the happiest phase of my life. I respect everyone, but I am not insecure.

You are currently rocking a man bun. Tell us about your style mantra...

I sport a man bun, because I have hair on my head (laughs). If you are a sportsperson or an actor, you need to have your own style statement. There were times when we dictated fashion, but now fashion dictates us. The brands tell you what to wear, how to walk. I am old school, and I’ll stay that way. I will wear my hair and my beard the way I like it.


You have spoken about the recent cases of brutality on students. As actors, how important do you think it is to let your voice be heard?

Actors speak up on matters that we feel need to be talked aloud. Many artistes even voice their opinions through their films/craft. Having said that, things do get a little taxing, sometimes; expecting actors to call out every time doesn’t make sense.


What else is happening for you as far as films are concerned?

Hera Pheri 3 is in the making. There are certain issues regarding the film, but all three of us — Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal and myself — are working towards making it happen. There’s also an American film, titled Fraudsters. The story is inspired by a massive call centre scam that happened in India."
"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,I am writing something for Telugu fans at present: Siddharth,"Given that he first tasted financial success in Tollywood, with Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, Siddharth has quite a following in the Telugu-speaking states. But the actor hasn’t done a straight Telugu film for the past six to seven years. Quiz him if he intentionally decided to focus on Tamil films during these years and he says, “I’d be lying if I say I planned all this. After Rang De Basanti, I was asked why I hadn’t moved to Bombay.,” he recalls, adding, “I was already in Hyderabad then. And I can’t live in two cities.

After that, I moved to Chennai, and I’m being asked why not be in Hyderabad as well. I want to work in different languages, but I want to be in one city only.”


So, is there any plan for a Telugu project in the near future? “I’m currently writing something for Telugu fans, and there are definitely plans to do films in Telugu. In fact, my current films are all tailor-made to work in both Tamil and Telugu,” says Siddharth, adding that his Telugu audiences are wonderful. I realise I have a beautiful audience there to whom I haven’t made a film for in some time. But if you look at the long game, all these are inconsequential,” the actor adds.

There will come one film that will change things. I started in Tamil, then went to Telugu and worked there for seven years without coming to Tamil. Then, I came to Tamil and have been doing films here for seven years without going to Andhra. I don’t know what’s going to happen next. Let’s see,” he says."
"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Anita Hassanandani turns naagin again,"Actress Anita Hassanandani, who played Vish in the previous edition of 'Naagin', will reprise her role in the current season. She says, “The supernatural genre has always excited me. Most people around you might say that the genre does not excite them, but in my family, everyone watches the show. During my travels, I meet a lot of people, especially kids, who enjoy watching shows that revolve around snakes and supernatural elements. I don’t think I can ever get tired of this genre.”

Anita will sport a new look for the show. She says, “This time around, I will wear leather blouses with my naagin costume. Getting ready for this character takes almost two hours, which is more than the time spent on getting ready for social dramas.”

Talking about her role, she says, “I am playing the antagonist and my character has many shades. I have always enjoyed playing negative roles.”"

"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Deepa Soman,Entertainment,"Filmmaker Rajasenan says, the brilliance of writer Raghunath Paleri and actors like Jagathy made the dialogues memorable","I had finished Ayalathe Adheham and was waiting for a good project.

That’s when Jayaram told me that lyricist Gireesh Puthancherry has the thread of an interesting story with him. When I enquired about it, I came to know that producer Goodnight Mohan has already bought it from him. I called him, he said, “I had presented it to many, but the film didn’t get made. If you are interested, you can buy it from my office.” I went to his office and bought the four-page thread, which was interesting.


I had an offer from Mani C Kappan and told him I have a story. By then, I developed this four-pager into a 15-page story. I asked Raghunath Paleri also to join us and all of us liked it. We further developed it in Chennai, and that’s when some of the important characters of the story were born, and we named the house, Meleparambil. Raghu named it. I asked him, why not add Aanveedu also to it? When I called Mani C Kappan and told him the title, he said it sounds different and nice, lets finalise it.

Then we started with the casting. Generally, one would first think of someone like Thilakan for the role of the father in the family. But from the time we were discussing the story, I had the face of Narendra Prasad sir in my mind. When I called him to talk about it, he said, “I am doing villain roles now. How will such a father’s role be suddenly accepted? Moreover, there is a humour element too.” I told him, “That’s what makes it different”, and he agreed to play the role.

As for the evergreen dialogues in the film, from ‘Velaikkariyayirunthalum Neeyen Mohavalli,’ ‘Ente garbham inganalla’ to ‘Amme pant pant,’ the credit goes to scriptwriter Raghunath Paleri. He is someone who goes deep into the psyche of characters and writes poetic dialogues and conversations. When talented artistes like Jayaram, Narendra Prasad and Jagathy Sreekumar deliver it, they also gain a special, memorable personality of their own. That’s why so many dialogues of one film is still used by people. There are certain scenes which has Raghu’s signature, like the one in which Jayaram tells Shobana, “Ingane okke aakumennu arinjirunnenkil nee ardharathriyil kondu vanna kuthira vandiyil njan kerillayirunnu”. It indirectly says, wrapped in humour, that it’s a cross that he took on his shoulders, but with wonderful cinematic impact.

While reading the script, the dialogue that made me laugh the most was the one Jayaram says to Shobana, ‘Nee njan Gulf il aanennu vicharichal mathi’. The time in which this film was made, it had a lot of weight. It wasn’t a time in which Gulf Malayalis took their family to the Middle East and many experienced a kind of longing and waiting period of two to three years to meet.

On the location, we laughed the most when Jagathy performed the ‘Amma pant pant’ scene and the one in which he runs into the water and says, ‘Baakki nanaju poyi.’

The location was Kunnathuveedu in Vaniyanpuram, Ottappalam. Film’s like Kamal’s Peruvannapurathe Viseshangal were also shot there earlier. But, we also attached a veranda to it, as many important scenes like the climax happens there.

Innocent was supposed to play Janardhanan’s role in the film, initially. It’s when we started shoot in Pollachi that Innocent called me saying he got another film as a hero, around the same time and should be excused from this project. We needed a replacement in nine days. That’s when I remembered the face of Janardhanan, who was on a train with me a few days ago. I could immediately see him as someone who is aged and unmarried. When I called to tell Raghu about the same, he said, “I think Janardhanan would be a better fit, than someone with a Thrissur accent amid characters speaking a mid-Travancore dialect.”

The Tamil portions were written first by Raghu and later translated to Tamil by K Balachander’s associate Bhanu Das, who knew the language well. There is a scene in which Pavizham’s dad Gounder tells Harikrishnan that though he doesn’t know how Harikrishnan’s family would accept Pavizham, he has accepted them. He says the dialogue, ‘Orothikku oruvanthaan enpathu Tamizh panpaadu,’ which means, ‘One man for a woman is the Tamil culture’. I feel not even Tamil movies would they have used one sentence to summarise the Tamil culture in this manner."
"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,I can commit to a film only if a script excites me: Aadhi,"Aadhi, who was last seen in U Turn, is eagerly looking forward to another bilingual, titled Clap. Directed by Prithvi Aditya, the film will have the actor in dual appearances — that of a sprinter and of a coach. The sports drama will have Aakanksha Singh and Krisha Kurup among others playing pivotal roles in it and music by none other than Ilaiyaraaja. Aadhi says he feels gratified to have landed a role which provides him ample scope to perform.

He explains, “It’s been a while since I have played the role of an intriguing protagonist in a Tamil film. I think Clap is the film which required me to undergo a makeover after Mirugam and Aravaan in Tamil. I often come across people who ask me why I take some time between each projects. I think I can commit a film only if the script excites me. When I come across a convincing script, I immediately say “yes” to it. When it comes to choosing a script, I follow my gut feeling. I’m currently doing three movies simultaneously.”"

"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,An actor’s career is about ups and downs: Sindhu Loknath,"In an industry where actors are not only expected to dole out at least one film a year, but also be ‘busy’ with work all the time, as out of sight can be out of mind, Sindhu Loknath’s journey of working on Kaanadante Maayavadanu has spanned over three years. She has not had a release in this time, but when she was not shooting for this film, she was busy starring in a musical (she played Charlie Chaplin in a performance last year), and globe-trotting. As she is set to bounce back from this ‘break’, Sindhu chats with us about her journey in films, the need to stay positive through tough times, and why despite the long wait, this movie will be a benchmark in her career...

‘Actors have ups and downs too’

I started shooting for this film in 2016, and due to the untimely death of Raghava Uday, the antagonist in the film who drowned on the set of Masti Gudi, the project was on hold for a while. It was quite a jolt for all of us. Nearly 80% of the movie had been shot and only the climax remained, so we were in a fix as to how to move ahead. The makers then decided to reshoot the second half with Bhajarangi Loki replacing Uday. And few new elements were added — we shot a song in Kashmir, and elaborate sets were erected for some sequences, all of which was time consuming. After that, of course, the VFX work also took time. People believe that actors need to be constantly busy, but we have ups and downs too. Sometimes we have packed, back-to-back schedules and other times we have months of break. An actor’s life does not have a set routine and after nine years in the industry, I am used to the nature of work. Having said that, the past few years have also been an emotional time, because having a project stall just short of the finish line and then struggling to release it, after completing it eventually, can take a toll on you. It has not been easy, but I try to stay positive and believe that there is a lot more in store for me. I am really glad that the movie is finally ready for release and hope this paves the way for more opportunities.

‘It’s a pleasure working with a known team’

The movie is a fantasy love story between a ghost and a human being and is a commercial entertainer. It was a pleasure to work with this team. I have collaborated with Vikas before and since he was involved with Kaanadante Maayavadanu from the scripting stage, he knew the subject inside out and would help me out with scenes. I have known Raj, the director, from our days on the set of Lifeu Ishtene. He was a part of Yogaraj Bhat sir’s team. Raj loves fantasy films, and that’s the genre this movie falls in.


‘Travel keeps me calm’

2020 has just begun and I hope the year has good things in store for me. Right after Kaanadante Maayavadanu, I have another film and a musical to look forward to. Apart from that, I also have my solo trips; I am soon heading to Bhutan. Travel keeps me calm. Whenever I feel low, I head out on a trip. It helps me find peace and discover new cultures and places."
"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,Bengaluru has changed a lot: Suniel Shetty,"Suniel Shetty, who was recently in Bengaluru for the Global Sports Injury Conclave, answered some quirky questions in a fun session with BT. Excerpts:
Are you the father who tells ‘dad jokes’ to his kids?
When I try to crack a joke, Athiya will, at least, respond to it. Ahan rolls his eyes and walks away. Perhaps, it’s the generation gap.

Is there someone you consider your style icon?

Jackie Shroff has always been my style icon. I think Dada (referring to Jackie) is still the most good-looking man on earth. It is not only about the clothes he wears, but also the way he carries it off.

You are a fitness freak. How does a cheat day look like for you?

Cheat-day dishes are whatever my mother cooks on a Sunday. Fish rawa fry and Kori Rotti (both Mangalurean delicacies) are my absolute favourites.


You have said that ‘Bengaluru has changed’. Would you elaborate on that?

During the initial phase of my career, I have shot multiple films in the city. I have amazing memories of this place — the roads we travelled, the hotels we stayed in, the locales we shot at. Bengaluru has also been the ‘big city’, where I used to come to meet my extended family. But, a lot has changed over the past decades. Although, Bengaluru is known for its pleasant weather, there have been times when I felt that Mumbai was cooler than Bengaluru. Also, the traffic here is insane and I dread coming to the city now."

"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 01:00 IST",Akash Wadhwa,TV,You are born with your colour and you need to love it: Poulomi Das,"Model turned actress Poulomi Das pretty much enjoys being a part of the daily soap scenario. The talented actress has worked in several television shows including Aghori, Dil Hi Toh Hai, Suhani Si Ek Ladki etc. She was recently in Lucknow to promote her upcoming show which is based on the life of a girl with a dusky complexion. Poulomi, who also happens to be dusky in real life too, is not just confident in the show but also very confident and sanguine in general. An elated actress said that she was quite happy to be doing a show where she gets to flaunt her actual complexion with much ease and poise. The dusky beauty spoke at length about skin colour and the whole taboo around dark skinned people in the industry. Speaking about people getting bullied for their (dark) colour, she said, “I was first made aware of my dark complexion when as a kid I had gone to attend a wedding with my family. This aunty just looked at me and told my parents that ‘your daughter is so beautiful. She’s slightly dark though. Don’t you think that’s a problem?’ and as an innocent 6-7 year-old I asked her why it’s a problem and whether it needs to be addressed medically. After that she was silent as she couldn’t answer my question. Later on my father told me that it’s no medical issue and it’s a colour I’ve been gifted with and is normal. Also, jab gora bolna gaali nahi hai toh kisi ko kala bolna gali kaise hua?”

Poulomi Das (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

“Right from school I was a tomboy with short hair and stuff. I never really got bullied and if at all anybody would dare to say something, I’d stop that person right there. However, if anyone would still say anything to me about my dusky complexion, I’d just tell them that they need to be well informed and that my melanin is way higher than theirs, which is good keeping in mind that there are lesser chances of me getting cancer or even tanned,” added the actress with a laugh.

The actress, who was in Lucknow to promote her show Kartik Purnima, also revealed that she never felt the need to use fairness products on her skin and ubtan was the only thing her mom ever applied on her face to make it glow. Poulomi said, “I used to ask my mother whether it’s possible to transform your colour by using a fairness cream and she would bluntly say ‘no’. She would say that it’s not possible in real life. According to my mom, fairness creams do not make anyone fair, you are born with your colour and you need to love it.”

Talking about people using products to become fair, Poulomi spoke, “I can’t say for others, but personally I feel it’s a waste of time and money. Plus, I love my melanin, it’s beautiful and so healthy, even scientifically. I don’t want to get rid of my melanin. I feel people should stop endorsing fairness creams. However, I’m glad to see that the commercials are getting better with time and aren’t just centered around complexion.” She further added, “Although I’ve been cast in other shows before this, a lot of times when I’d go for auditions, people would say things like we’re looking for a North Indian girl. In my head, I used to wonder who is this stereotypical North Indian girl? How does she look? So I won’t deny that a bias for fair complexion is there. It very much is, but it’s changing gradually. Hopefully, we’ll get to see women of darker skin tones also playing leads in TV shows. I’ll try to bring about that change,” added Poulomi with a wink.

"Created: Jan 24, 2020, 01:00 IST",Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Rassasy By Barcelos,"One of the greatest perks of my job? Interacting with you, my reader. Even better is dining with you as my foodie blind date. And of course, being in constant touch (like I have been with many a reader) is the best upside.
Here’s the biggest downside... a disappointing restaurant and pronouncing it so. So while I was happy to catch up with a long-time loyal reader and that too on Shilpa Chawla’s birthday, we were disappointed by the restaurant’s food. The lovely, lively Shilpa, a social media influencer, loves micro blogging and has been exploring new restaurants for the past 18 years, which is roughly the time she has been in touch with me. I went back alone to Rassasy By Barcelos, several weeks later, ordered across the menu and, once again, the mish-mash of a menu did not pass muster.

DÉCOR
Tucked into the gleaming ORB right next to the international airport, the large space is brightly done up. Its wide 28-feet bar offers a range of drinks. Artworks adorn the walls, reflecting the good old days, and there’s a separate smoking lounge, too.
FOOD
Italian, Portuguese, Mexican, American... you name it. However, only four dishes (amongst the long winding multi-cuisine menu) passed muster.

Chicken mince meat balls were moist and tasty, smeared with slightly sweet tangy tomato sauce. Quesadilla with corn paneer? Thankfully, tasty and generously portioned, too. Chicken Espetada on a skewer was succulently tasty one dinner and overcooked the next. Hearty Italian stallion chicken sandwich. The African influence is present in the choice of four peri peri sauces. There are plenty of cocktails as well.

MINUS POINTS
Can anyone get guacamole so wrong? So bitter? On my second visit, guacamole wasn’t available. Can Tiramisu be rancid? Cheesecake, too? Below average thick, chocolaty Opera.
Avoidable, dry biscuity base pizza. Overcooked aglio olio pasta. Intriguing ‘Black Burger’ is stodgy. Lacklustre Trinchado Portuguese curry with rice Avoidable, seriously small chicken wings with peri sauce and peri mayo.


MY POINT

Rassasy By Barcelos, the intriguing name of this African chain of restaurants propelled us from South Mumbai to the airport. Its indifferent mish-mash fare had us retreating right back. I’m fully aware of the investment of money, time and dreams that owners put into restaurants. And while I can empathise with them, my first duty is to you, dear reader. So, I went back unannounced to the restaurant for the second time. And though only ever so slightly better, the below average mish-mash of Mexican American Portuguese et al disappointed. We’ll stay away till they get their act together.

'My VIP salute has to be perfect'


Though it has not been an easy task for the team, one thing that all of them followed since the beginning was that they won""t give up. Seema Nag, 36, who will be leading the group, says, ""It is a very big opportunity for us and we will definitely make everyone proud,"" adding, ""I will be doing the VIP salute as I am leading the group. While doing stunts on bike, we keep a lot of things in mind. Keeping a track of our starting and end point is important. I want my VIP salute to be perfect. While doing that, I will have to balance the bike and its speed. We are not supposed to exceed 25-30kmph. So whenever I am riding a bike otherwise as well, I make sure that my speed does not exceed this limit."" Sangeeta Mishra, 45, who would be riding a ladder during the act, says her kids will be proud of her when they see her on TV. ""In 2014, I did my first show and since then I have been performing stunts with the group. I am climbing a 7ft ladder and upar jaake mount hoti hoon. My body and brain need to work together so that I don’t panic and lose my balance. My family feels proud when they see me. My daughter says that there is nobody like her mother and my son says that he would like to write a book on me. All this is really precious for me,"" she shares.


'We work on two things – focus and trust'


The team says that they work on two things – focus and trust. Sujata Goswami, 47, has been riding bikes since she was in college. ""For the R-Day Parade, you will see me riding a bike with five other members. For our stunt, balancing is really important. Once I attain the balance, I ask others to take their position. While practising, we started with two members, then we added two more and then the final one on top. Ladkiyon mein josh tha karne ka. Woh giri bhi hain, chot bhi lagi hai par jab hum uniform pehen lete hain toh ek alag si proud feeling aa jati hai,"" she explains.

The actor, who incidentally began his TV career by playing a struggling actor named Anand in Chumma, is now popular as superstar Jeeva in Kasthoorimaan. The son of veteran Carnatic musician Palai C K Ramachandran, Sreeram is also a singer and it’s no wonder with this enviable fan following that he has topped the Kochi Times Most Desirable Men on Television poll for 2019. The Thattathin Marayathu and Uyare actor shares his delight bagging the most desirable man on TV title. Excerpts.
What are your thoughts on being chosen as the Kochi Times Most Desirable Man on Television 2019?

I feel really happy. I have been following Kochi Times and it’s a proud moment for me to win this title. It’s a boost to my career. TV has been a popular medium in Kerala and when I am chosen as the most desirable man on TV, I realise that I have been accepted by many and that feels special.
What qualities do you think make you desirable?

I am someone who prefers to choose the path less travelled. Whenever I do something, I try to make it subtle and simple. Considering the struggles that I have endured, I have never been able to do anything loud, but I try to be genuine. I think that’s what makes people like me.

What qualities of a woman make her desirable to you?

I do not have to go anywhere to find the qualities of the most desirable woman as I see them every day at home, in my better half Vanditha. She is benevolent, compassionate and socially committed, and that’s why she has chosen a career as a speech therapist. Before meeting her, I was unaware of such as career option and what I attracted me to her was the commitment she has to the society.

How would you sum up your journey in the career you’ve chosen for yourself?

After acting in films such as Malarvadi Arts Club and Thattathin Marayathu, I began my career in TV through Chumma in 2012 and went back to act in Shyamaprasad sir’s Artist. Again, I came back to mini screen to do Kasthoorimaan. There is a common notion that an established actor in mini screen will not be able to return to Mollywood, I really wanted to break that stereotype. Actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Sushant Singh and Madhavan came into films after becoming popular faces in television. I came back from films to small screen as I wasn’t getting much opportunities in movies, but I got the mileage from TV to return to Mollywood with a bang. Acting is acting, no matter the medium.

Who do you think are the most desirable man and woman in the country?

I am a hardcore fan of Hrithik Roshan, not just because he is a handsome actor with a chiselled body, but because I admire his dedication and perseverance to chase his dreams. He was someone who was bedridden due to a severe back injury; many told him he can never dance again. He overcame that and became one of the best dancers of Bollywood. Later, he was diagnosed with chronic subdural haematoma and I remember reading his mom’s interview where she said how Hrithik, smiled and gave her confidence just before getting into the operation theatre for surgery.

My most desirable woman is Priyanka Chopra as she is now living her dreams. She became an international actress through her hard work, attitude and dedication.

Do you think you owe your success to your hometown, Kozhikode?

Of course. Kozhikode has been always an encouragement for my career growth. It is a place where you will have at least five people who would encourage you to do what you are good at. Kozhikode being my hometown is special to me.

How has your experience in the industry been?


I am still taking baby steps in my career and I am not sure, if I am qualified to assess my experience. It was during my second year of engineering that I was smitten by films. I decided to complete my course, become secure and then venture into films as there is always an element of luck in becoming successful in films. My dad is a musician and I was also focused in music but acting was always there in my mind and it eventually happened. I began as an assistant director and slowly turned an actor.

I prefer to take life on day-to-day basis and whatever I have gone through in life has become an inspiration for me while acting, so I would prefer to take the energy that I gain from the industry to perfect my characters.


What do you think about Mollywood as a film industry?


Right after watching Anjaam Pathira, I was comparing its making and quality with Hollywood films. It’s great that we are raising our standards and keeping it high. I am proud of being part of films like Uyare that are making a mark. Our Malayalam films by those like G Aravindan, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, John Abraham and now Lijo Jose Pellisserry, have always been looked upon by filmmakers across the world. It is interesting to see our filmmakers treading their own path and making films that are unique in their narratives, making and even gender sensibilities."

"Created: Jan 25, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,It’s heartening that theatre is thriving all across Karnataka: Anant Nag,"Veteran actor Anant Nag started his career in theatre at the age of 19 before making a shift to the silver screen. It, therefore, makes him the ideal celebrity to inaugurate the upcoming edition of the Bahuroopi National Theatre Fest at the Rangayana Theatre in Mysuru. “My first visit to Rangayana was for its inauguration in 1989. Since then, I have gone back there only once, for the festival, when Prasanna was at the helm. I am glad that I will be inaugurating the Bahuroopi theatre festival at a time when there are so many experiments happening in theatre.”

Reminiscing about his days in theatre, the actor says, “When I started my career, I was a part of Konkani theatre and went on to do 50 plays in the span of just five years in Mumbai under directors like Prabhakar Mundkur, Venkatrao Talageri, RD Kamath and KK Suvarna, all of who gave me varied roles. It was only then that directors like Amol Palekar and Satyadev Dubey took note of me and gave me the opportunity to act in Hindi plays directed by them. Interestingly enough, I have hardly done any Kannada plays, except the few directed by my brother, the late Shankar Nag.”


Although Anant has not been active in theatre for a while, he has been keeping track of developments in the field. “There was a time when people used to complain that there are no takers for plays, but today, if there is interesting content you will absolutely find an audience. I am happy to see that theatre is thriving even outside of Bengaluru. For any budding actor or filmmaker, I believe that theatre is the perfect platform to pick up the nuances of writing, acting and direction,” he wraps up."

"Created: Jan 25, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,A script needs to resonate with my musical sensibilities: Amit Trivedi,"Right from his early albums like Aamir and Dev D, film composer and singer Amit Trivedi has always been drawn to off-kilter scripts. A decade into the industry, this is something that the National Award-winning composer still looks for in films. Most of his works that have worked have always resonated with his sensibilities, said the composer in an interview, ahead of Indradhanush, his three-hour experiential concert today in Chennai. Excerpts from the interview:
Tell us about Indradhanush...
It means an emotional ride. We will depict seven different emotions — love, sadness, anger, hope, courage, fear and friendship — through the songs. We have worked with a huge team and it is my dream come true. A very long time ago, I had created this song called Nikhra Hai Rang Indradhanush. This was almost around 25 years ago. I could not find an outlet for it back then. I wanted to use that line somewhere and wanted to use it in my show. The idea for the concert came from that song.

These past two years have been splendid for you. Numerous films apart, you were also behind arguably some of the best albums of Bollywood, like Andhadhun and Manmarziyaan. How does 2020 look?
2020 looks great and I am looking forward to it. I share different relationships with all directors. I share a beautiful working relationship with Anurag Kashyap. Sriram Raghavan is such an inspiration and I have always wanted to work with them. I gel really well with filmmakers like these. There was Kedarnath also, which worked out really well. Numbers wise, it fared far far better then Manmarziyaan or Andhadhun. It has been a great year. These directors add a lot to the music because their passion often rubs off on me.
You are known for a very intimate and intricate style of music, that is very narrative. How important is it for a composer to know the entire script?
There is a medium that I am composing for and cinema is that medium. I need to know the film inside out to compose music. Otherwise, it is difficult. I need to relate with the directors and the milieu of the setting. Once you connect to a film, things flow naturally. And there are times where you don’t connect with a film. In these situations, you just have to see through it. We are professionals and just have to give our best at the given circumstances.

Most of your films have explored unconventional subjects, like you have mentioned in interviews. Does that excite you to make music?
A script needs to resonate with my musical sensibilities. And most of my films that have worked have resonated with my sensibilities. When that happens, the work automatically ends up being beautiful and I do end up giving my best.

You have often called Dev D your turning point. Do you think the music was way ahead of its time?
I don’t know if it was way ahead of time (laughs). I had no idea it would turn out to be such a big rage. I was just composing music as I would normally do for any film. Anurag sir loves songs. When he heard the music, he became so excited. He actually rewrote the entire script around the music. Even in 2020, we have a film releasing, and the process is the same. He tells me to make the music first, which inspires him and then he starts writing the script around it. It is so beautiful that when you watch the film, the marriage between the visuals, the music and the storytelling is seamless. It is what I call the Kashyap magic.


How important is a lyricist’s contribution for music?
It is the most important thing. Lyrics is the face of any song. The combination of composition, lyrics and singing is what makes a song a song. I love good poetry and thoughts put into simple words. Anand Bakshi used to do exactly that in the olden days. Now, we have Amitabh Bhattacharya, Javed (Akhtar) saab, Gulzar saab, and so many who do that in Hindi cinema. I have always had a beautiful working relationship with all my lyricists. Javed saab wrote Iktara and Sham from Aisha, 10 years back. The songs still resonate with people and covers of them are still being made. I hear a Sham cover almost every day. It is not just the music that has stood the test of time, but it is also the writing, which has a timelessness to it. Amitabh Bhattacharya’s work for Dev D is still talked about.


Which has been your most challenging song or album?
The only challenge that I face is when the director does not understand or want the music that we compose. It becomes a challenge to crack what exactly the director wants at times. Any or every album is difficult to crack at the starting stage because it involves creating a new idea out of a blank space. Once you crack that, it becomes easy.


You have composed for the south Indian remakes of Queen. Will we see you compose music for more Tamil films?
I would love to do more Tamil films. I had a great time composing music for the Queen remakes. The directors were really cool. But I think the project has run into some trouble right now, and it is on an absolute hold. But the soundtrack has turned out very beautifully. I want it to come out soon. The experience was a great one."

Known for its nostalgic charm, the play, based on a novella by the same name, sees the doyen among actors take the stage as a narrator. Amid lights and music, he embarks on a journey with the audience, investigating the mundane voices that riddle the life of a lonely woman, named Amma Bi, in her deserted Lucknow haveli. “It’ll be an evening of theatre in Bengaluru,” says the veteran artiste, who is set to present a dramatised reading of Dopehri in the city, a tale he had penned nearly 30 years ago. “It’s an entertaining piece that brings alive literature on stage,” he adds. Presented by Flo Bangalore, the show will be held at Chowdiah Memorial Hall on February 6. Pankaj finds Bengaluru to be a culturally-aware city. “Every time I am in town, either performing a play on stage or speaking at a literature festival, I have noticed that people here are very well-educated and informed. Audiences respond to each nuance of a performance — be it storyline, structure or dialogues — which is kind of encouraging for the artiste,” he says. When he had brought his play, Saher, to Bengaluru a couple of years ago, several local actors were made part of its ensemble cast. “We usually don’t get the time to watch local plays when we are travelling with a production. But this gave us the opportunity to interact with local actors. And it was a good experience,” he explains.

When asked about his perspective on India’s current socio-political situation, Pankaj says, “People are already speaking up about what’s happening in the country right now. I don’t think there is anything new to add. But all I want to say is that every human being is the same, and everyone should be treated with equal respect.”

Amid all the travelling, film shoots, stage performances and writing, the veteran actor also takes time out to be with his grandchildren, Misha and Zain. He says, “I usually meet them on Sundays. They are delightful kids. I don’t get to spend as much time with them as I would want to because of my work schedule. But, like any other grandfather, I am indulgent when I am with them.

The actress and her artiste husband Steven Graver (known as Tony) have moved to Goa. The duo shifted there three months ago, and are now happy to make it their home. Narayani, who was born and brought up in Mumbai, says, “Earlier, we used to live in Andheri, and till the time my shows were shot at Film City, I was able to manage the commute. However, in recent times, many television sets moved to Naigaon and the commute became very long.”


Narayani says, “We even moved to Goregaon to reduce the travel time, but it didn’t help. At times, it would take me almost two-three hours to reach the set because of traffic jams. It meant coming home to just sleep. I really needed a change.” She further says, “My husband is a painter and he, too, wanted to move to a place that’s quieter, so that he could work peacefully. We both felt that we should explore Goa as an option.”


However, the actress says that Mumbai will always be close to her heart. Narayani says, “Mumbai is one of the best cities in the world, but it’s sad that because of the growing population and traffic situation, people are stressed out and on the edge — be it the bhajiwala, the shopkeeper, the cab driver or anybody on the street.” Ask her if she will continue to shuttle between Goa and Mumbai for work, and she replies, “Work will always be my priority; if I don’t work at all, I will lose my mind (laughs!). At the moment, I am doing a few short films and ad campaigns. In the future, if I take up a TV show that will be shot in Naigaon, I will rent an apartment there, as it is not expensive. I can work during the week and return to Goa over the weekends. This way, I can have the best of both worlds.”


Meanwhile, she is loving the quiet and calm of Goa. She says, “Now, when I look out of the windows, I can only see a long stretch of green landscape. I live in Siolim, which has one supermarket around the corner and the house is spacious enough for my pets and us. I have adopted two dogs and nine cats, and they are quite a handful! My husband is teaching me how to paint and every evening, we take the dogs for a swim on the beach.”"

For starters, Manisha has reverted to her original surname. “I’ll be called Manisha Jashnani henceforth,” she says. Ask her what prompted her to take a break and she says, “It was a conscious decision. My mom was unwell and I wanted to be with her.

"Updated: Jan 26, 2020, 12:56 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,Could eSports be a medal event at bigger platforms?,"For the longest time, the general perception of video games was that it was a colossal waste of time, much to the dismay of hardcore gamers. Gaming, they maintained, requires a lot of quick thinking, hand-eye co-ordination and so much more. Over the years, professional gaming has been growing and gaining recognition with events across the world. But its inclusion at the recent Southeast Asian Games 2019 as a medal discipline has really upped the ante for the sport. Not only did the gaming community see this as a validation of their passion, but it also raised their hopes for eSports to be included in the Olympics, given that the Southeast Asian Games are supervised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). “Imagine playing a video game and winning a gold medal for your country in the near future? Now that eSport was a part of the 2019 Asian Games, it will revolutionise the way Indians (and others across the world) see the potential in this field,” says Bengaluru-based professional gamer Vishal Rangwani.
The game changer
“The SEA Games 2019 signifies a new dawn for the eSports industry with its inclusion as a medal sport,” says Vishal, who adds that
discussions for it to be included in the Olympics are reportedly going on. Despite the huge numbers involved, the business-first nature of eSports — and the question of whether leisure gaming is a sport at all — has made the Olympic movement cautious. But gamers feel differently. ""It is all about national pride and these games also require dedication, focus and planning. It would be wrong to say that it’s only a leisure sport,"" says Ankit Panth, a professional gamer from Mumbai, who is also the brand ambassador for a software giant that is conducting an eSports tournament in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.


The growth of eSports in India
“We are just getting started with gaming in the country. Tournaments like ESL India Premiership and Dreamhack India getting international eyeballs and bringing talent to our country, is a big thing. With the rise of Pubg Mobile tournaments, mobile gaming has been exploding. Internationally, the eSports market will reach $1.8 billion by 2022. A more optimistic scenario places revenue at $3.2 billion. The audience growth is expected to grow to 645 million in 2022. But the icing on the cake is the recognition that we as players can get through a medal event. Getting a medal gives us the kind of respect that other professional sportspersons get,” adds Ankit.
Destination Olympics?
A software giant announced an esports tournament in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The firm said that it would sponsor an Olympic-endorsed event with a prize pool of $250k for each game. The tournament is to be held between June 22 and June 24 in

Well, as it turns out, Meghana Raj has, and Republic Day brings back warm memories for her. “I was in Class 9 and belonged to the junior wing of NCC 8 KAR BN company under the Karnataka and Goa Directorate. As a cadet, representing your state at the Republic Day Parade in Delhi is a big deal. Only 18 cadets are selected from the junior wing to represent the state at the parade and I was one of them. It was a prestigious moment and it was a first for my school (Baldwin Girls High School) as well,” says the actress.


Reminiscing about her training days, Meghana says, “We had to be all-rounders and had to be good at everything including cultural activities. Our marching had to be perfect, as well as the drill. We also had to be good at singing and dancing. Once in Delhi, we had to train for one and a half months and I remember it was extremely cold when we got there. Even then, we would wake up at 4 am and have a full day of practice, only to hit the bed after midnight. The pursuit of perfection was such that even the slightest mistake meant that would we would be caned or get some other form of punishment for an entire day”


But that’s not all, Meghana also got a chance to perform for the then prime minister Manmohan Singh. “From the junior wing, I got to perform in front of the prime minister and meet the then Air Force Commander. After the parade, we headed straight to the NCC decamp, a 15-day camp held at the outskirts of Bengaluru, which was also quite memorable. The decamp had a more relaxed setting. Those were the days before mobile phones, so staying in touch with family was not easy. I could talk to my parents, say, once in 5-6 days.

The artiste had earlier sung a medley of 50 Kannada songs. This time, however, Eesha has sung 100 songs on one beat.

“I chose American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth’s How Long beat, because when I had begun working on this series last year, this song was very popular. On the recommendation of a few friends, I put together a medley of 100 popular Kannada songs that were released between 1975 and 2019,” says Eesha. This medley, according to Eesha, is an attempt at bringing something new to the Kannada industry, while retaining the essence of all the songs. “Some of these old Kannada songs had chords similar to the English track I chose. Also I picked songs that had a little fast tempo. I wanted to use a hero-music director combo, but then figured that it wouldn’t work out. So, I just chose songs that were popular and went well with the beat. Selecting the appropriate songs was a tough job. And while doing so, I also had to keep in mind the popularity of those songs. It was also important to maintain the energy throughout, because some of the old songs were melodious but slow numbers,” she explains.


So, what’s next? “I think I will wait for the feedback from my listeners and see what they want to hear next. Based on their suggestions, I will work on my next medley,” the singer signs off."

There has been many conversations between Sidharth and Shehnaz’ bed changing situation in the past.

Now, Shehnaz has decided that she will sleep separately and moves her blankets and pillows. She is unable to take any more insults and doesn’t want to get hurt. Sidharth, who was sleeping on the bed while Shehnaz changed her bed, doesn’t react.


Asim tells her to stick to her decision and now she can’t go back to Sidharth. If she goes back, she will look weak. He says, he doesn’t know if it is wrong or right, but the matter has now come down to her self-respect.

Shehnaz goes and sits with Rashami. Rashami tells her that she is acting very possessively and she shouldn’t act like that. Sidharth doesn’t like such person because he himself is very possessive. He feels like Rashami goes on to reveal that during their show (Dil Se Dil Tak), they used to have small fights initially because of his possessiveness. Later, when they became good friends, she started to understand him.


Rashami calls Sidharth a baby in a man’s body."

"Created: Jan 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,The unstated rules of personal space,"There’s a scene in Downton Abbey — set in early 1900s Britain — that had left everyone in splits. The dowager countess, played by Dame Maggie Smith, much to the amusement of the audiences, asks: “What’s a weekend?” Our grandparents/parents have a similar response when we talk about personal space. An almost-alien concept even a decade ago in India, it’s difficult to explain what constitutes ‘personal space’. But understanding it is the need of the hour in our country.
Terms like ‘alonetime’, ‘personal space’, ‘boundary’ are hit social media hashtags these days as more and more people are negotiating (and renegotiating) conventional boundaries set by old societal standards.

The great intrusion
Digital expert Chetan Deshpande believes we are living in times of great intrusion in our personal space. A call from an unknown number, email from spam advertisers, WhatsApp from unknown people – all leave us annoyed. On top of that, the daily breaches of personal space — people standing too close to us, a seemingly mundane comment like ‘how much will you shop?’ — can make us irritable, angry.
For instance, a friend once told me she was going to the salon, when someone from her family told her: “Why go to the salon so often? Didn’t you go last week?” For my friend, the question was invasive. What we must understand is that most of the time the ones who invade our personal boundaries are closest to us, and possibly do so without realising it (see box). Similarly, a colleague was once perplexed when a friend’s friend — who had just moved in to her apartment building — landed at her doorstep without calling her.

What changed?
In India especially, personal space as a concept has suddenly come to the forefront because we have jumped quite a few emotional communication hoops in a very short time. We had hardly moved from joint families to a nuclear one when the Digital Revolution changed our lives drastically. And just when we were getting used to gadgets, social media changed the way the whole world communicated. From a conservative approach towards life, we were posting our ‘relationship status’ out in the open.

Marriages today aren’t just ‘big’ and ‘fat’, they are “Insta-worthy’. Divorce isn’t jaw-dropping news, couples remain friends after separating. Add the rise of single women, and you have a completely new India, where the SELF has gained precedence. Life coach Pankaj Rai says, “In such a scenario, personal space isn’t a luxury. It’s as important as the air we breathe, the water and food, we consume. We need personal space for our sustenance; it’s an important ingredient to evolve as human beings. Every person lives in his/her own world, made up of his/her own TIME and own SPACE. And this TIME/SPACE is sacred to all of us.”

Corporate coach Farzana Suri concurs. “We are all made of experiences, likes, dislikes, and ideas. Personal space is the buffer space that allows you to focus on yourself and the things that uplift your soul by being YOU. In your personal space, you do not have the burden of playing all the roles you normally play in life because you have to,” she says.

Workplace culture
Along with changes in personal relationships, workplace culture has changed drastically too because of this same need for personal space. Says author Vaibhav Datar, “People are now demanding a work culture that lets them be; they want more intimate work stations, where they can focus on the job as against the open office policy that had become a rage. Now, office spaces are being designed keeping the new requirement of employees in mind.”

If we don’t protect our personal space at work, we are more likely to feel drained. Datar adds, “You may often feel hurt and angry for what seem like minor infractions to others.” In fact, the need for space is so important that even intense perfumes in closed places, talking loudly in public places, are putting people off pretty quickly.

Says Anu Mehra, dentist, “We are relearning to communicate. Social media has altered all our perceptions of what’s considered rude and what’s decent. For eg., if someone adds you on his/her FB, Insta, is it okay to keep sending them messages, saying “hi”, or “where are you from” or “I really like your smile”? Some may consider it just another way of communicating, while others would be very uncomfortable, even angry, with such messages. I personally consider it an invasion of my privacy.”

That’s another conundrum. How do we navigate our personal spaces in an extremely public world? Can we put up posts describing our everyday lives, and expect our personal space not to be invaded at the same time?

Family counsellor Gitanjali Sharma says, “Personal space is no longer the immediate space that surrounds us and moves with us. The next time we look at our phones to send a text message, it’s within the prism of our private space. And the danger is that it can be ‘hacked’ (read unsettled) by a single text or online message by anyone – it may be a family member on a WhatsApp group, a friend’s snide comment on Facebook, or a stranger saying ‘hi’ on platforms like Messenger and Insta DM, not caring about whether you are okay with it or not.”

Adds Mehra, “Because of this constant intrusion in our ‘smart’ lives, we now have to fight for personal space much harder – the reason why we are clinging to hashtags like ‘alonetime’ or ‘personal space’. We have to take radical steps to block intrusions in our lives.”

Every relationship requires a balancing act between personal spaces and giving precious time to your loved ones. The way we are in 2020, one cannot happen without the other.

Every relationship is a balancing act with personal space – between personalities, between desires and between spending time together and giving yourselves time apart
— Shakti, dancer

Personal Space Etiquette
- The most serious aggressions often come from those closest to us. Communicate
- Observe boundaries in office. Observe professional distance and reserve more intimate gestures for after hours
- Call it to the invader’s attention — personal or professional — and give time to correct the behaviour
- The immobility or inability to manage personal borders generates a high emotional cost

Science of Personal Space
Ralph Adolph and Daniel P Kennedy, neurologists at the University of Caltech (US), discovered a structure in our brain responsible for telling us where the limits of our personal space lie. This structure (amygdala) is associated with fear and our survival instinct


We are all made of experiences, likes, dislikes, and ideas. Personal space is the buffer space that allows you to focus on yourself and the things that uplift your soul by being YOU

— Farzana Suri, corporate coach

Personal space is the physical, psychological and emotional region of a

person, in which one feels comfortable and free. You feel offended when an unknown person is too close to you and invading your personal space

Malavika has made her presence felt in the industry since the time she first came on our screens in the hit show Ponnambili, and then in the supernatural, multi-lingual Nandini or now as Anjana. While she says in her disarming manner that she doesn’t know quite what earned her the title, she is thrilled with her big win. Excerpts from the interview.

How do you feel about winning Kochi Times Most Desirable Woman on Television 2019?

I am very happy about getting the title, particularly as this is the second time that I am winning. Also, because I had won in 2017, I was not expecting it again, and that is doubly exciting. It is also a real boost to the confidence when people give you a title such as this.
What qualities do you think make you the most desirable?

I honestly don’t know. I don’t have an answer for this. Maybe it is the characters that I play on screen. They have a certain lovability about them and people have a heartfelt connection to them. It is also perhaps because I am not the most extroverted person. I am usually in a shell and don’t do many interviews even, so people don’t know much about me and there is a curiosity factor. Also, I am not a serious person. I laugh a lot, no matter how silly a joke. I find that there’s plenty to be happy about.

What do you find desirable about a man?

Actually, his personality and how he treats a woman. It is the first thing that we note about a man. If they do not behave well with a woman or speak badly about them, it is a real turn off. I think a woman would want to get closer to a man only if he is good to women; that increases their desirability quotient.

Who do you think are the best examples of a desirable man and woman?

The person that immediately springs to mind is Prithviraj. I have been a fan of his since his Nandanam days and in the past year, he was really able to take it ahead to another level, socially and career-wise. He was able to successfully take forward everything he put his efforts into and really stamped his presence again in the industry.

The most desirable woman would be Nayanthara. She is iconic in all ways.

How would you say you have evolved as a person over the years, since you first debuted in the industry?

I participated in a beauty contest in 2009, but I was a very shy person and I did not know how to say no, even when it came to work. But when I am put in a situation where I have to say no, I will say it. I feel this is my best quality now. And I think, people find it difficult to say no to others, because they are concerned about how they will face that person again. You have to be bold to be able to do so, and I think that has been my greatest evolution.


How has your experience been on the job?

I love being on the sets of Manjil Virinja Poovu and the credit for that goes to director Rajeev Nedumkandam sir, scriptwriter Jayaprasad Parnashala and producer Unnithan sir. In fact, it doesn’t feel like being at sets; this is like my second home. We are shooting for 20 days at a stretch and it would feel monotonous, but the atmosphere here is so friendly and there is so much co-operation among everyone that it feels really pleasant. The energy and positivity on the sets is inspiring.


How do you see your career progressing?

Nothing in my career so far was planned and I think, let things continue to progress organically. What is in your destiny is bound to happen."
"Created: Jan 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nupur Amarnath,Lifestyle,All woven together,"When Kochi-based designer Sreejith Jeevan put up an Instagram post about the need for variations in Kerala handloom, many commented that it should remain as is, untouched. And perhaps, unevolved. But Jeevan believes that even though we need to preserve tradition, for the weavers to earn and for the craft to sustain, variations are needed to keep it relevant – to the craftsperson and to the consumer. This thought has taken roots in the Indian fashion and textile design circles, where many designers and entrepreneurs are working to keep the traditions not only ticking, but staying ahead of time.
Take for instance, how Palak Shah of Ekaya Banaras and Sanjay Gupta of Raw Mango have added a different colour story to Banarasi to create a fresh new aesthetic. Designer Payal Khandwala crafts her own version of Indian modern, using Banarasi weaves. Anushé Pirani works with Indian handloom, khadi in ikat, bagru, Kashmiri thread embroidery to create contemporary ready-to-wear styles. Richana Khumanthem of Manipur runs an eponymous label that uses Northeastern fabrics in fresh cuts. Rina Singh of Eka believes in tweaking the crafts. She says, “As designers, we cannot re-invent crafts, they have been there for years. But what needs to be understood is that if they continue to do what they have been doing there is nothing new that would be created.”

The tweaks are subtle but significant. For instance, Kolkata-based Ron Dutta of Fatherland worked with jamdani for his sarees. He explains, “We worked with the weavers, but the motifs or alignments used might not classify as jamdanis.”
A TWEAK IN TIME
The grand doyenne of Indian textile tradition, Ritu Kumar, is heartened to see the current interest and experimentation with handloom in India. She notes that it’s only in India that even now that there’s a living tradition of weaves and textile – “which in other countries have been relegated to museums”. Jeevan agrees, and adds, “One of the biggest reasons crafts stay relevant is that tradition and modernity have found common ground.”
As someone who has been working and researching textiles for years, Kumar suggests not intervening with the process of handloom (unless you are a textile designer) but the form and the way it is used. “One of the biggest push to handloom is the popularity of bohemian style with its asymmetric cuts that plays to the strength of our weaves,” she says. Jeevan notes that design is the way to upgrade crafts. “No one will buy crafts to ‘protect’ or ‘preserve’ or ‘save’. Crafts will survive when it is relevant.”

SEEKING RELEVANCE
Shah says that everything needs to be evolved based on what the market demands. “The key idea of working on traditional crafts is to stay close to the roots. It has to be evolution – and not a sudden change.” For instance, you can update colours, density of the fabric you are working with, and add new motifs. In the process, you also teach the weavers newer skills. “It has to be a measured evolution. You can’t go from grade A to Z, just move to A++,” she says.
For young designers working with their native textiles, it’s also a fight for preserving their identity. Designer and illustrator Easternlight Zimik (from Manipur) started working with traditional textiles when he realised how important identity is after his experience outside his state. His illustrated series #textiletalk has started a conversation on Northeastern weaves. “When designers use indigenous craft or textiles, there’s a need to understand the value or sentiment of the story. For many tribes of Northeast, each textile represents something they value vitally, and defines their uniqueness,” he notes.
Pirani feels that fashion schools should focus on these crafts as a part of the course along with modern aspects of fashion. Jeevan notes that handlooms too follow trends – not the fast fashion kinds but enough to bring freshness. He says, “Style can co-exist with tradition; it’s not a crime to make that tweak as long as craftsmen and customer find a connection.” And that connection is happening.

"Created: Jan 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,-,‘I’ve always admired Arun anna for his dedication and hardwork’,"I became a fan when...
It was during my college days that I caught up Yennai Arindhaal on the first day, first show after which I became an ardent fan of Arun anna. His character in the film, Victor, made a huge impact on me for various reasons. The dialogues of that character were apt for people who struggle to achieve in life. That’s why I got connected to the role and became his fan. My favorite dialogue is Yengalukkum kaalam varum, kaalam vandha vaazhvu varum, vaazhvu vandha anivaraiyum saagadipomey. I started growing long hair like Victor and my friends started calling me with that name thereafter. Another reason why I admire anna is because of his hard work, dedication and ‘never give up’ attitude.


The craziest thing I’ve done as a fan...

Video editing has been my hobby for a long time. I once made a video of my favourite character Victor and uploaded it on my YouTube channel and posted it on my Twitter handle. Arun anna was tagged on it. Later, that night, he replied to it, saying, “Good edit bro ...Thank you, Victor was an unforgettable journey.” After a year, I edited one more video which he shared on his social media accounts.

When I met my idol...

One day, I got a message and call from the head of his fan club, thanks to the videos I edited. He appreciated me for the video, which made me happy. After a few days, I got a chance to meet anna at his home through him. I was happy to see him as a grounded person. He enquired about my well-being. He made me and a few other fans to sit there and offered cool drink. For some time, I couldn’t believe it was true. Later, I clicked a couple of pictures with him, which made my day."
"Created: Jan 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Nona Walia,Lifestyle,Rat’s the way,"The year 2020 is the Year of the “Geng Zi” or Yang Metal Rat. In simpler terms – it’s the Chinese Year of the Rat. Rats, according to the Chinese, signify influence, intuition and insight. And the rat energy is being celebrated by luxury fashion houses such as Dior, Burberry, Gucci and more by launching special collections. To curate the celebratory symbolism of good fortune and prosperity, Dior launched a capsule collection featuring gold hues and red.
RAT-A-TAT

Gucci’s Rat year collection features the world’s most famous mouse – Mickey Mouse. Classic pieces such as monogrammed coats and fitted plaid wool shirts with extended collars are restyled sporting Mickey Mouse iconography. Moschino too has launched a special Chinese New Year collection featuring a darker version of Mickey Mouse. Going as Mickey Rat, the designs are stitched onto varsity jackets, backpacks, and cotton T-shirt dresses as patches.


But more than just clothes, as the first year of the 12-year cycle, the Year of the Rat, is expected to set the pace, template and direction of the next 12 years. Feng shui expert SBS Surendran says, “The energy of the year has a combination of elements which imply hidden good luck but could be quarrelsome. The year is good to prepare for. Go for long term planning and be cautious.” The Rat is a symbol of prosperity and financial well-being. Therefore, 2020 will be especially successful for starting a new business. At the same time, it is worth remembering that the Rat does not like unjustified risk. Therefore, you need to act slowly and think about each step.

-Rats are clever, quick thinkers; successful, but content with living a quiet and peaceful life

-Lucky colours: blue, gold, green

-It is believed that a crystal vase or glass broken on Rat’s New Year’s Eve brings good fortune"

"Created: Jan 26, 2020, 01:00 IST",Riya Sharma,Lifestyle,Captain Tania Sher Gill: I am very ziddi. I would have tried to be in the fauj till my last attempt,"She became the first woman to lead an all-men contingent at the Army Day parade earlier this month. Standing tall and leading the contingent as parade adjutant, Captain Tania Sher Gill will now be seen leading the Corps of Signals contingent at the Republic Day Parade today. Three days before the D-Day, on the day of final dress rehearsal, we caught up with Tania. While she has been hogging the limelight in the media over the past few weeks, she came across as a shy person who “does not like taking pictures while everyone is looking”. “I am an introvert,” she told us, right at the beginning of our interaction. For our interaction with her, we were joined by two NCC cadets – Shreeshma Hegde, all-India NCC Rajpath Parade Commander, and Mansi Kandiyal, Platoon Commander from Rajpath NCC contingent, to interview her. Mansi is from Uttarakhand Directorate and Shreeshma is from Karnataka and Goa Directorate. The cadets were excited and nervous to meet Tania who told them, “ Tum log toh badhe ho gaye ho!”, before explaining to us, “I have met them earlier during our practices at Cariappa Parade Ground.” What followed was a free-wheeling chat on Tania advising the young cadets not to give up on anything that they are passionate about, her ‘ ziddi’ temperament that lead her to join the forces and why one should not focus on their gender before joining the fauj.
NCC cadets: When you lead your contingent, what goes on in your mind?
What goes on in my mind is that your contingent (NCC) is coming behind me, so if you can do it (leading your contingent), then I can also do it.


NCC cadets: What inspired you to pursue a career in armed forces? Ever since I was a little girl, I have seen my father in uniform. So I always had it at the back of my mind that I also want to be a part of the forces.

NCC cadets: We also want to join the forces. But we have seen that whenever a girl from the younger generation thinks of joining the forces, their family is not always supportive because they feel that girls won’t be able to survive in the forces. What would you like to tell them? If you are passionate about it, you should just go for it because you only have one life, jo bhi hai, josh type karna hai, so just go for it.

NCC cadets: How is training in OTA (Officers Training Academy) for a woman officer?
Training is the same for a male and a female officer because the same qualities have to be imbibed in both. At the end of the day, you want to become a good army officer, irrespective of your gender, and training is something in which you learn a lot. You grow as a person.

NCC cadets: But are women in armed forces treated equally?
Once you wear the uniform, you become a fauji. It is the same for everyone. Your religion, gender, region does not matter. Once you wear the uniform, you have to do justice to it.

NCC cadets: We bet it is tough to live a life like that.
If you are passionate, then every day when you wake up, you’re grateful for this life.

DT: You have said in a lot of interviews that you always wanted to be an officer, but did you ever have a backup plan?
I had got placed in TCS in the final year of my college, but since I was more passionate about the fauj, I never joined it.

DT: But was that a backup plan? If you would not have got into fauj, then would you have joined the company?
No. I’m very ziddi. Agar fauj mein nahi hota toh I would have tried till my last attempt.


NCC cadets: Our generation, especially young cadets like us, are really inspired by you...

There are so many women that I look up to, so even if there is one person who gets inspired by me, it means a lot to me.


DT: You’ve also become a social media star with people posting and sharing your videos. Have you seen them?

I believe whatever we faujis do, we do it irrespective of who is seeing us and who is noticing is. We do it for our Naam, Namak and Nishan.

Starring new comer Zaid Khan and actor Sonal Monteiro, seen in film Abhisarike, the first spell of the shoot had to be discontinued due to chilly conditions earlier this month. “The weather made us stop and now we are back for at least a week’s schedule in the city,” says the director. Quite in awe of the place, Jayathirtha says, “ I first came here ten years back for my first film Olave Mandara. Since then the city remained with me and I always wanted to come back to shoot an entire film in Banaras. It is a unique place where various cultures co-exist. You see cremation on a ghat and Ganga aarti on the adjoining ghat going on simultaneously. This is the beauty of the city that epitomises divinity and mystery. There are so many layers to the city which is rather unimaginable. We have already shot for more than a month in the city but I feel we have captured only ten per cent of Varanasi. There’s so much more to the city. Even the music of Varanasi is amazing. Apart from the song rendered by Sucharita Gupta, a known singer from the city, we have also recorded song of a boatman who has a mellifluous voice. I am not using Banaras for my film, a love story, but it is the other way round. I am using my film to show Banaras,” he says.

Even Sonal Monteiro is glad to be back for the shoot. “I was here for the earlier schedule of the shooting. Since it was my first time in the city, so people warned me that it will be really cold. I came all ready with my stoles and shawls but nothing worked as it was really cold. Despite the weather, I had an amazing experience. I saw the Ganga aarti and visited the various ghats. I went back with such great memories that I couldn’t stop talking about the city even while shooting for other films in Bengaluru. Even the Banarasi food, especially the sweets, is awesome,” she says.

Sonal , who plays a Banarasi character in the film , says, “We did a lot of research on how the Banarasi girls dress up by checking on the pictures of Banaras. I even worked on the body language, for instance I had to be very comfortable on the boat like you know it’s my place. I was expected to be from Banaras and not from South India,” she says."

An impressive list of outings followed, and in 2019, he headlined URI: The Surgical Strike, for which he picked up a National Award. Naturally, expectations are sky-high from his younger brother, actor Sunny Kaushal, who was noted for his controlled performance in Reema Kagti’s sports drama, Gold (2018).


When we met Sunny recently, we asked him if his brother’s repertoire and his achievements in a short span have put him under duress to deliver similar results. The actor, who is currently filming Shiddhat with Diana Penty, told BT, “A lot of people often ask me this, but I just think that Vicky and I have our own journeys. He has worked hard to be where he is today. As his sibling, I feel extremely proud of him, but I don’t put myself under any pressure. I just want to work and entertain people.

Making most of his visit, the Sahjahanpur-born actor visited his alma mater Bhartendu Natya Akademi (BNA) in Gomti Nagar. The Lucknow Central actor, who is a 2011 batch pass-out of BNA, believes that whatever he has achieved today is because of the institute. Sharing his feelings while visiting the institute, he said, “It was kind of a rebirth for me during those two years when I was studying here. I owe everything to this institute.” Talking about meeting with his mentors and the students, the Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo actor says, ""This visit to BNA was a memorable one. I met the students there and visited classrooms and hostel, I also spent a good time with my teachers Chitra ma’am and Lalit Singh Pokhariya sir. A lot of memories got refreshed as we chit-chatted about memorable incidents while I was studying here. They also shared their life experiences with me, it was kind of a master class for me. I also got opened the BM Shah auditorium where I staged my life’s first play. So, the visit was a nostalgic one for me, a kind of complete flashback for me. I had a great time here!""

Alok has also done films like PK and Sanam Teri Kasam. He also has shot for many movies in Lucknow including Batla House and the Pankaj Kapoor-starrer Saher. Talking about the increase in the number of shoots here, he says, “It always feels good to shoot in Lucknow as I have studied and spent a lot of time here. The good thing is that Lucknow and its people have become familiar with the shoots and have been very cooperative. It is also a boon for actors who are not able to move to Mumbai for various reasons.”

Sharing his feelings of working with John Abraham in the film Batla House, Alok says, “John Abraham was very supportive during the entire shoot and even appreciated my work a lot. By the time the shoot ended we were sharing a very good rapport. He is a very keen learner and it was a big surprise for me when an actor of his stature asked me about how I prepare for a role, the process of getting into a character and more. So, it was an overall great experience.”"

"Created: Jan 27, 2020, 00:00 IST","Ashish Joseph, Sharanya CR",Entertainment,Reel Kapil vs real Kapil at the Chepauk stadium,"It felt like a match day at the MA Chidambaram Stadium (Chepauk stadium) in Chennai, with live commentary by Krishnamachari Srikkanth. At the crease was Ranveer Singh and bowling to him was Kapil Dev, while the ‘Kapil’s Devils’ from the film 83 was fielding. As the game progressed, Ranveer even managed a hook shot off Kapil’s bowling. Then, they swapped places, with Kapil taking the bat and Ranveer bowling to him. Even as they enjoyed a few moments of cricket at the Chepauk stadium, they chatted about the making of 83 (a film that chronicles Kapil Dev’s journey and India’s historic win at the 1983 World Cup) and memories of the game. Excerpts from the conversation:
What Kapil misses the most about his cricketing days…

If you ask of us what we miss about 1983 today, I would say that we miss the energy we had inside the team bus and the dressing room. Those things we miss, sometimes, even more than playing cricket.
Ranveer on how he reacted when the story was narrated to him

It’s more than a film. It’s a story that’s probably about one of the most glorious chapters in the history of our nation itself. It even changed the attitude of the nation. Suddenly, Indians looked upon themselves. Because what the Indian team of 83 did was unprecedented and unheard of. I didn’t know half of the things that happened back then. When Kabir sir narrated the story, I was like, ‘Aise ho? Aise thodi? It’s not possible’.

When Srikkanth gave Jiiva ‘tuition’

One day, Jiiva came to me for tuition. ‘Saar, eppadi aadanum. Konjam sollikudunga, saar!’. I told him, ‘Inga paaru kanna, nee chumma poyi naalu suthu suthu. Sariyayidum’ (laughs).

Jiiva recalls Srikkanth’s words of wisdom!

I still remember what Chikka (Srikkanth) sir told me. ‘Chumma kanna moodi suthuda. Patta baghyam, padalenna leghyam’. (laughs).

Kapil taught us the concept of self-belief: Srikkanth

I have said this a million times. There was only one guy who believed from day one of the 1983 World Cup that India could become the world champions and that was Kapil Dev. He taught us the concept of self-belief. Your boss gives you targets, right? It was like that. Roger Binny and I were like, ‘What the heck is this guy talking? Beating West Indies?’. But this guy was so serious about it, man!

No, we don’t want to do that; that was our first reaction to making the film: Kapil Dev

When we (the players of 1983) were told about making this film, our first reaction was like, ‘No, we don’t want to do that’. Because we felt that we were still young and a story should be about something that happened 50 or 100 years ago. But at the end, everybody, including me, said, ‘Fine, if they want to give us respect and love through the film, then, why not?’.

I’m glad that I got a chance to do it: Kabir

Watching the 1983 World Cup finals…

I remember seeing that match (1983 World Cup final) as a school kid. I saw the whole world around me explode and go mad. At that point of time, I didn’t know why the whole world reacted the way it did then. Now, when I make the film 83, I exactly know the reasons why it was like that. It’s one of those stories that’s been staring at our faces for the last 36 years, yet nobody picked it up. I am really glad that none picked it up because that’s why I got a chance to do it.

Natraj shot came naturally to Ranveer

On the first day of the training itself, when the ball came at a certain height, the Natraj shot came naturally

I wish I had directed the film: Kamal Haasan


Kamal Haasan, who launched the first look poster of the film, said, “I heard about the touching moments that director Kabir Khan told me, which we didn’t know. The cricketers were not even given enough laundry budget and they were supposed to wash their clothes on the tour. We see movies called Avengers with a lot of supermen flying around. But these cricketers are the true avengers. I was also told that there is a very important sad story but very heroic in its own way, which the team had recorded it in the film.”


Kamal added, “It is very difficult playing real people. The best thing to do is to be yourself, but respect and admire them. I think Ranveer Singh has done that in whatever little I have seen of the film.Mimicking can be slightly insulting. You need to imbibe the spirit to play a role, and play Kapil Dev. Also, Srikkanth… he’s such an effervescent guy and it is very difficult to emulate him.” Looking at Jiiva he said, “I am keen to see what you’ve done, Jiiva.”


He said that, as the filmmaker of Hey Ram, he envied Kabir Khan. “This is the best compliment I can give you. I wish I had directed the film. But I don’t have that much experience in cricket and passion as Kabir Khan. And that’s why I can’t whine about it; instead, I feel proud about it.”"
"Updated: Jan 28, 2020, 11:02 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,Listening to the National Anthem before a game gets us charged up: Women’s football league captains,"Ahead of the launch of Indian Women’s League for football that is currently underway in Bengaluru, we caught up with the captains of the 12 teams. These women, range from some who have been playing the game on a professional level for over two decades, and a few more who are involved in the game even as they pursue their undergraduate courses. Each player, though, is thrilled to be able to captain their team and hope to take back the trophy to their club.
‘The Football league is a great first step’
Shyama Rani, captain of BBK Dav FC from Punjab, points out that this league, in its fourth season now, is a good start to encouraging women to pursue a career in the game. “We need more such platforms. This first league is a good step. We need to keep at the practices even after the leagues and tournaments in order to move ahead,” she adds. Ashalatha Devi, who hails from Manipur and captains Sethu FC, adds that sponsorship and other such incentives are missing in women’s football. “Players who hail from smaller leagues in men’s football have sporting companies sponsoring their kits and other gear. Not a single player from women’s football has received such a sponsorship. If we get such backing and incentives, parents of women playing football will feel secure. It will also act as an incentive to push girls to pursue the sport,” she adds.

Mooting the thought is Amoolya Kamal, captain of Bengaluru United FC, who also questions why men’s football, despite the growing popularity, doesn’t see as many endorsement deals as the cricket team gets. “We need more people to call Sunil Chhetri for an advertisement that is done by Virat Kohli, for instance. While the awareness is growing, there needs to be more push by people on social media, along with more press coverage,” she adds.
‘Many players find minor setbacks demotivating enough for them to quit’
Anita Rawat, captain of Kickstart FC, believes that it is easy for one to give up in a team sport. So, keeping oneself motivated all the time is important. “Youngsters who may not be able to perform well on a certain day or week might be asked to sit on the bench during games. This can bring one’s morale down and can even get them to consider quitting the sport. Instead, they should look at the seniors and get inspired,” she adds. Priya Mistry, captain of Baroda Football Academy, reiterates, “It is a team game. Whether you’re on the field or on the bench, you remain a part of the team and you must never lose focus. Dedication and hard work is important. When you have that opportunity, be proud and patient when standing up to the task.”
FACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST
Ashalatha says it is the National Anthem that inspires her, a sentiment that others agree upon too. “When I enter the ground and we sing our National Anthem, I get goosebumps and get emotional. The outcome of that feeling itself is important to give me that strength,” she says.
Poli Koley, captain of Sreebhumi FC, Kolkata, says it was the Indian team jersey that she received a week before her father succumbed to cancer that keeps her inspired. “My father was bedridden, but he had tears in his eyes when he saw my name in the newspaper. So, when I got back home, I gave him my jersey to wear. I want to reach higher and ensure my father's dreams for me are realised.”

Others agree that the Indian team jersey is a big motivation. Amoolya says, “When I got the number 14 jersey for India, I got emotional and my eyes welled up with tears, as I got to realise my dream. From that day, I’ve always prayed to the jersey, irrespective of which team I am playing for. The little prayer gives me a lot of confidence in myself.”


‘Not many girls take up the sport, when they do, they must be encouraged’

The captains agree that women’s football is taking small steps towards growing bigger. But, there is a lot that needs to change, and they believe that begins with the approach and mindsets of parents. Amoolya, who is a coach too, says, “When it comes to women’s football, parents play an important role. Many parents think ‘usse lag jayega’ and also ‘puberty ke time pe kya meri bachchi khel sakti hai’, I have had many parents tell me that it is better if I coach as opposed to men coaching their daughters. This mindset needs to change. Not many girls choose football, so when someone has chosen that path, parents need to support her, instead of creating roadblocks.”

Then focus on how you communicate with your special someone. That online dating has kind of changed the way people meet and connect is no secret. Interestingly, whether or not you follow the new lingo, there is a term to describe all your adventures (or misadventures). A closer look at words like ‘ghosting’ and ‘breadcrumbing’ also shows how pop culture as well as our favourite movie and telly characters have influenced the online dating lexicon. So, if you’re game for upgrading your vocabulary, here’s a ready reckoner…
KANYE-D
Yes, that’s right. ‘Kanye-d’ is inspired by American rapper Kanye West. This refers to a situation when you’re on a date or in a relationship with someone, but you don’t get to talk about yourself at all, because the other person is busy bragging about himself or herself.
Say it like a pro: “I heard that he Kanye-d her on their first date itself.”


JEKYLLING


Picture this: You’re finally with your dream girl or guy, and suddenly, there comes a red flag. He or she turns out to be a completely different personality, similar to the lead characters of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Inspired by their personality differences, ‘Jekylling’ is referred to someone who becomes nasty if you turn them down over a small thing.
Say it like a pro: “It was all cool till she started jekkylling me when I cancelled our dinner date.”

FLEABAGGING
This term is inspired by actress-director Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s award-winning series, Fleabag, in which the lead character faces a lot of difficulties because of her dating choices. What led to the coining of the term ‘fleabagging’ was her falling for a ‘hot priest’ in a church. Now, this term is most commonly used when one falls for the wrong person.
Say it like a pro: “These past few men in my life have made it a complete Fleabag of things.”

KEANU-ING

This term emerged after actor Keanu Reeves’s fans were taken aback when he made a quick appearance on the red carpet of an event, hand-in-hand with his girlfriend, artist Alexandra Grant. The actor, who is known to keep his personal life under wraps, had sent netizens into a frenzy after this buzzy appearance. ‘Keanu-ing’, thus, means surprising everyone by making a grand entry into a party along with your new love interest.
Say it like a pro: “She pulled off a total Keanu, I wouldn’t have guessed them together at all.”

CASPERING

Adding a character reference to the already popular term ‘ghosting’, ‘Caspering’ is when your date drops enough hints for you to guess the obvious before he/she disappears or ghosts you.
Say it like a pro: “So, you picked him up last night, or are you caspering him again?”


ELSA-D

Do you feel that your partner is ‘frozen’ when it comes to commitment? This term is commonly used for relationships, in which one of the partners often develops cold feet. ‘Elsa-d’ is inspired by the popular Disney character Elsa, who froze her sister, Anna, by mistake, over an argument. Her frozen heart led to the birth of the term online.

Say it like a pro: “I heard that he Elsa-d her right before she walked down the aisle.”


BIRD-BOXING
Sandra Bullock’s award-winning film, Bird Box, is what led to the term ‘bird-boxing’. It refers to a partner in a relationship who

ignores bad behaviour.

Say it like a pro: “Greta, I know that you can see me standing here. Don’t bird-box me.”"

It’s at this juncture, wherein the last few amongst the survivors are looking to expand their clan, the film delves into the happenings in their life. “The poster shows Anupama who plays Dwaya, her love interest Ekva played by Satya BG, and Trinini, essayed by Mayuri Nataraja, standing atop a cliff and pensively looking forward to a better future. There’s a halo behind them and a symbolic snake that is eating itself which a reference I’ve drawn from the Bhasmasura tale. Set in a fictitious land, there’s a mountain, Rikta that has borne silent witness to their lives and it stands tall in the background,” explains Pradeep, adding that Bhavani Prakash and Raghava also play prominent roles.

"Created: Jan 27, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,"If I could, I would have become a hero in my 20s: Director Vikas","He was the director behind Duniya Vijay’s Jayammana Maga, and since then, he has worked on Puneeth Rajkumar’s Doddmane Huduga. However, it is Vikas’ debut film as hero, Kaanadante Maayavadanu, that has kept him busy over the past four years. The process has been “emotionally and physically challenging, but has taught me patience,” he says, as he recounts his journey with the film, which he believes, will decide his future in the industry.
Many directors have taken up acting. You too are taking the same path. When did you first think of turning a hero?
When I was a kid, I would see villains being quelled by heroes and I wanted to be like them too. It seems to be a funny and childish thought, but that was the initial spark that got me interested in acting. In fact, before I directed Jayammana Maga in 2013, I entered the industry in 2002 and played a role in Sudeep sir’s film, Nandhi. So, even though this is my first film as hero, it is not my acting debut.

You have worked on this film for over four years and have been a part of the initial scripting process too. Did the lengthy process lead to frustration?
I got very frustrated. The time the process took, got to me and took a mental and physical toll on me. I started looking aged as the film progressed, because I was getting stressed (laughs). We know that the product is top-class. When promoting it, what worried me was that there was not much hype around the film. Just like you can’t ‘make’ viral content, you cannot ‘create’ hype. In the process of worrying, I would not eat or sleep well. There are certain things I cannot control, but ultimately, people will recognise good content, and that realisation has made me calmer.

What were the challenges you faced in your first role as a hero?
I realised how crucial the hero’s walk was — walking with attitude and confidence takes practice. It took me a few takes to get it right. I often felt lost while watching my co-stars — be it Suchendra Prasad or Sindhu Loknath. I was stunned by their prowess. If I could control things, I would have become a hero in my twenties. Right now, I can’t act like a college-goer who’s romancing girls. It won’t be convincing. I want to take on roles that suit my demeanour. I know that many stars have had a second lease of life after 40, especially in Hollywood. Actors still get a lot of work and take up interesting scripts. Those are the kind of roles I wish to play. I have learnt how challenging marketing one’s film can be. Everyone wants their movie to be promoted on a big scale. But, one realises that stars have that kind of pull, because they have worked their way up and built an audience. Given that this is my first outing as a hero, I have realised that building an audience takes time. I would consider this movie as an invitation card, like a preview to what I can do. Depending on how the audiences respond, things will either go to a great level or I will take my leave from the industry (chuckles).


What do you think has helped you sustain in the Kannada film industry?
My dedication towards perfecting my project, and reworking on it, have helped me sustain myself in the industry. Even after working on a film for a long time, it should not get boring. That’s my mantra. Scripting also comes easily to me and I have only worked on two scripts in the last few years. If I focus on scripting, perhaps I can do a lot more. Let’s see. God is writing my script. So, I do not know what he has in store.


Who has been your constant support in this journey?
My constant source of support has been Som Singh sir, the producer of this film, who also happens to be my brother-in-law. In my life, I have spent more than I have earned. And my family has always been my support. As the release date is close, I am worried about the audiences’ reaction.

"Created: Jan 27, 2020, 00:00 IST",Prathibha Joy,Entertainment,Multi-tasking as a producer and an actor gives you a certain high: Milana Nagaraj,"Love Mocktail is a very special film for Milana Nagaraj. Not only does she play one of the leads in this love saga that tracks the story of one man and the women he meets at various stages of his life, it also marks her debut as producer. Milana has co-produced the film with her co-star, actor Krishna, who in turn, has also directed it, as a project steeped in passion. As first-time producers, who have been managing most departments of production, the two have been running helter-skelter to make sure the film meets its date with audiences. “I have lost a few kilos running around for this film, but I am glad that we are presenting a product that we are proud of,” says Milana.

Speaking to Milana — the producer, is a welcome change altogether, considering that acting was not part of her long-term career plan until recently. “I have been an actor for five years and always believed that it was a folly for an actor to turn to production. First of all, getting into cinema, growing and making a name for yourself and being able to command a decent remuneration, is not an easy job. After all that, when you set out to produce, what is the guarantee of recovering your money? Love Mocktail, I believe, happened because there is a limit to how long you can wait for a good script to come your way. As an actor, you know your capabilities to perform, but when you don’t get avenues to show that talent, then what do you do? You have to create your own platform,” says Milana.


So, when Krishna, her good pal from their Nam Duniya Nam Style (a Kannada film that featured them in lead roles) days, spoke to her about the idea he had for Love Mocktail, it excited her. So much so that she took it up even though the storyline features three heroines. “You will realise the importance of my character once you watch this film. As an actor, the one thing that I have learnt is that you cannot survive if you worry about anything more than just the character you are assigned to play. For me, all that matters is being able to do my best in the space that I have, and letting the others also do the same to make a quality product. My character is a lot like me in real life and I really enjoyed playing the part,” she says, adding, “I can’t start feeling insecure about things in my own film. If someone is praising a character, I should take pride in having presented that.” And while both Milana and Krishna have donned multiple hats in this journey of making the film, she adds that the support of the crew, including people like composer Raghu Dixit and editor Sri (CrazyMinds) was invaluable.

Now that she has made baby steps in filmmaking, and learnt the ropes with Love Mocktail, Milana says she is confident about taking up more projects. “I have loved the experience. Multi-tasking as producer and actor does take a toll on you, but when you succeed at what you set out to do, it gives you a certain high,” she signs off."
"Updated: Jan 27, 2020, 10:19 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,TV actor Suraj Holalu Yogesh heads to Telugu screens,"Television actor Suraj Holalu Yogesh is testing new waters. He has made his debut on the Telugu small screen with a prominent character in the TV show Chitti Thali. The story of the show, directed by Radhakrishna, apparently focuses on the relationship between a father and his daughter. “I play a character who has gone through a loss of memory and is leading a life as a rather jovial, small-time thief. The character goes through an emotional turn when he discovers that he has a daughter. Naturally, this is very different from what I have been portraying in the Kannada show Yaare Ne Mohini,” says Suraj. Foraying into Telugu also means learning a new language. “Not knowing the language thoroughly was an initial hindrance. But the director assured me that I could, indeed, carry it off. I am still dependent on prompts to get my diction right, but I am learning fast,” he says."

"Updated: Jan 27, 2020, 13:22 IST","Gunjan.Sharma@timesgroup.com, Riya Sharma",TV,Bharti Singh: Delhi ke logon mein bahut talent aur jazba hai,"It is not the first time that comedienne Bharti Singh and her writer husband Haarsh Limbachiyaa are coming together for a show. What makes this time different is that the two are coming together for the very first time as television hosts. While Bharti has hosted shows in the past, this will be her first with her husband. In Delhi for the auditions of 'India's Best Dancer', Bharti and Haarsh talk about their experience of working together, the changing scenario of comedy in India, and more.
Jo hamari masti screen pe dikhti hai wo spontaneous hoti hai: Haarsh Limbachiyaa
Before coming together for 'India's Best Dancer', the couple did shows like 'Khatra Khatra Khatra', 'Khatron Ke Khiladi' and 'Nach Baliye' together. The duo says that while they do have to work on their script, their on-screen bond that comes across to the viewers comes naturally to them. ""Whenever we are working together, main bilkul relaxed ho jaati hoon. I don't have to do much work. The one who used to teach me earlier, jo script likhta tha mere liye and samjhata tha mujhe, ab jab woh act bhi kar raha hai, toh I am very relaxed,"" says Bharti. Haarsh adds, ""Thoda pressure aa jaata hai mujhpe lekin hum log prepare karke jaate hai. But jo bonding hamari screen par dikhti hai, jo hamara masti mazaak dikhta hai woh ham kabhi prepare nahi kar paate. Woh sab spontaneous hota hai. That comes naturally to us and we just go with the flow.""

'Delhi ke log bahut talented hain, it's so cold here par inka jazba kam nahi hai'
Bharti and Haarsh say that they are impressed by the pool of talent in the capital. ""Delhi ke log bahut talented hain. It is so cold here but inn logon ka jazba kam nahi hai. Raat bhar se line mein lage hue hain,"" says Bharti. Haarsh tells us, ""I am surprised to see the number of talented dancers in the city. With so many dance reality shows on TV, I thought that there is not much left to discover. But I was wrong.""

Talking about Dilli ka khaana, Haarsh tells us that everything is delicious here. ""I really like the food here. Honestly speaking, Mumbai mein sab kuch milta hai lekin achha khaana nahi milta. Yahaan par toh kuch bhi kha lo, everything is delicious,"" he says.

'Logon ko aaj bhi sabse zyada hansi desi humour par hi aati hai'

Bharti began doing comedy on television 12 years ago, and she feels that over time, people have learnt to take humour in good stride. She tells us, ""There are a lot of people who just want to laugh, and there are others who want satire. But these days people have become a lot more intelligent. Aajkal mazaak lene lag gaye hain log."" ""India's comedy scene has seen a tremendous change in the last ten years,"" says Haarsh, adding that while comedy on TV has evolved, people still want desi humour. ""We have new topics to explore now. Jab nayi baatein karte hain toh comedy bhi nayi lagti hai, but logon ko aaj bhi sabse zyada hansi desi humour par hi aati hai,"" says Haarsh.


'I wish there were more women doing comedy on television'

While the TV industry (drama genre) is ruled by women, comedy is visibly male-dominated. Talking about the same, Bharti explains, ""People either want to be a model, or bag the lead role in a show. Kisi ko apna mazaak nahi banwana. Pata nahi kis baat ki sharam hai unmein. Maybe that is the reason why there are fewer female comedians on TV. Mujhe bhi dukh hota hai to see such a state, and I wish there were more women in this genre, too.""

As a writer, Haarsh believes that it is easier to write jokes for a man playing a woman instead of writing them for a female artiste. He explains, ""Sunil (Grover) paaji ladki ban kar kuch bhi kar sakte hai, we can ask him to say anything, but we can't do that with a woman. Kahin na kahin woh daayra hota hai and that's why we ask people like Sunil ji and Krushna (Abhishek) to dress up as women. You will never find comedy in real things, but you will laugh when Sunil ji dresses up in a weird fashion."""

"Created: Jan 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Arya UR,Entertainment,Dharmajan Bolgatty : I had to wait a decade to play a central role,"From his signature expressions to hilarious repartees, actor Dharmajan Bolgatty is the go-to comedian in Malayalam films these days. The actor who has completed a decade in films is much loved for his roles as a sidekick in films and as the partner in crime of Ramesh Pisharody in stage shows and comic skits.
This year, however, marks a change in his career as Dharmajan will be playing a serious and central role in Maradu 357, directed by Kannan Thamarakulam. In his words, it will mark a kind of shift from his brand of comedy and that has already got him excited. In a free-wheeling chat, Dharmajan opens up about his new projects, his cameo in Bigg Boss Malayalam 2, his family and more.


From a comedian to playing a character role in Maradu 357, how does it feel?

It has taken me 10 years to get a character role. It’s not that I have never wanted it, but I got a chance only now. We can perform such a role when we are offered such a script. I have been tagged as a comedian and have been receiving humour-oriented roles in my career so far. Also, the wait was for a person who had the courage to back a film in such a genre with me. I have played sidekicks and foolish friends of protagonists, but this is the first time I am getting to do a central character and that too of a serious nature. I hope the film will mark a change in my career. For this film, they wanted the actor in Dharmajan and nothing more.

Tell us about your role in Maradu 357.

I will be playing a security officer of a flat. His name is Mani and has only one arm. He lives with his old mother but says, ‘Enikku vanamutte bhandhukal aanu (I have relatives till the sky)’ as he sees the residents of the flat as his extended family
The demolition of highrise buildings was there only in foreign countries as they used to de-commission timeworn buildings.
The film’s script is written by Dinesh Pallath and it tells the story of the people who lived in those flats in Maradu that were demolished and those who worked in them as sweepers and other staff including Mani. It wasn’t just the elite, the flat also accommodated middle-income families who had invested their entire savings to own a house. For them, owning a flat was like the happiness we get while eating a biryani instead of a regular meal.

Personally, I have also lived in a flat complex for a year, so I know how sentimental one can be when you are forced to leave. More than a film, I also have some personal sentiments attached to the script. I felt happy when Dinesh added my inputs and experience in the script when we were discussing it.

For the character, I have grown a beard and moustache. I am now 43 years old and it’s the first time that I am seeing my face with a beard. I will be using the look for my future projects too.


Recently, you made a special appearance in the new season of Bigg Boss Malayalam.

Yes, it was a short visit, for a day as a guest. It is a whole different world inside the house as there is no clock or calendar to check the time or date. I know most of the participants except Reshma, Sujo and Rajith sir. Pashanam Shaji, Manju, Thesni and Parikutty had told me about being part of the show. I know many of them personally and they are doing well in the show.
To be frank, the participants are a mix of elite and middle-class people. I entered the show at 7 pm and came out the next afternoon. It was very different for me as my day starts with expecting the newspaper boy to turn up with the daily. It has become my habit to read the newspaper while going to the toilet, but at Bigg Boss House I had to read the guidelines sheet instead (laughs). But all our habits will change if we have to live in the Bigg Boss house as it is such a place.


Who do you think will win this time?
From my experience and watching the show, I feel Fukru is the best contestant. Many of them are acting, but I felt Fukru was genuine.


You also seemed to have hit it off with Fukru.

As part of the promotion works of my film Margamkali, I had met a group of talented Tik Tok artistes including Fukru. I had clicked a few selfies with them. My daughter Vyga who was checking the photos on my phone got very excited seeing his snap as she is a fan. I wondered why she was so happy seeing the face of a Tik Tok artiste as opposed to taking pictures with prominent actors like Dulquer, Mammukka and more. I had to call Fukru at 10.30 pm as Vyga kept insisting that I make her talk to him. Vyga also performs Tik Tok videos and when she received appreciative messages from Fukru, I got to see her beam. So, I know him well now.


You had once mentioned that your name is unique.

I am small, but my name is big. I have always thought about that while I was a kid as to why my father named me thus. In school, I had this big name which was quite contrary to my appearance and height. My teachers used to mispronounce it as Dhananjayan or Dharmarajan. But when I did mimicry and acting, it became a unique name and my identity too. Now, I like it when people call me Dharmu, Dharman, Bolgatty et al.



What are your upcoming projects?

Apart from Maradu 357, I play a serious role in the film Voter too. It’s about an illiterate layman named Gopi, who resides in this secluded island. His views on democracy and life on the island forms the subject of the film. Things change when a group of officials including presiding officers comes to the island to get his vote. It is a national subject and the film is directed by debutant Sagar."

"Created: Jan 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,No starry tantrums make social media celebs a hit at city college fests,"Given that digital media consumption has seen a massive surge over the past decade, it’s no wonder that artistes who have a huge fan following on social media platforms are among the most sought-after offline too. The growing popularity of YouTubers, DJs, stand-up comics as well as reality TV stars on college campuses attest to this new trend. These social media celebrities are now judging competitions at city colleges, while some also perform during events. What’s making them such a rage among youngsters?
Students find these artistes more friendly and relatable
The popularity of these celebs on social media automatically translates to them having a bigger influence on the young demographic, says Ushua Prashant, a student of Mount Carmel College. “The audience at college fests mostly comprise those under the age of 22. Again, it’s the same age group that spends most of their leisure time on social media, watching these celebs’ videos or browsing through their pictures. It, thus, makes sense to invite them for campus events, because many students look up to them,” explains Ushua.


‘Social media celebs are more accessible and less demanding, as compared to movie stars’ “If the artiste happens to be from Bengaluru or from the same college, it’s a plus point. Some of these social media celebs may still have friends or acquaintances on campus. This makes it easier for us to get access to them. And when we approach them, they oblige without much persuasion,” says Ushua. Students find many of these artistes just like themselves. “Unlike film stars, who often need elaborate security that we cannot afford, social media celebs don’t make too many demands when we invite them to be part of our college fests,” says Vismitha Simha, an organising committee core member at Jain (deemed-to-be) University, Centre for Management Studies.


Comedians and DJS help build the buzz for college events

According to student organisers, famous online artistes help create the right amount of buzz around college fests. “Collaborating with social media celebs also means more participation and footfalls at our events,” says Vismitha. DJs and stand-up comedians performing at fests is an added advantage. “We have had comedians like Aravind SA, Papa CJ and Saurabh Pant taking the stage at our cultural events earlier. Interactive shows are a big hit among students, particularly when comics crack those classroom jokes. DJs also have a similar influence on young crowd,” says Rebecca D’Silva, cultural secretary at RV College of Engineering.


Students love the internet- famous artistes because…


No-frills attitude
Easier to connect with and relate to
They speak the millennial lingo
Fit in the college fest budget
Greater social media reach"

However, towards the end, it seemed like she was losing her sheen and was voted out over the weekend. Soon after her exit, Shefali spoke to BT about her journey on the show, proximity with friend-turned-foe Asim Riaz and her equation with Sidharth Shukla. Read on...
You were inside the house for three months. How would you sum up your journey?
It’s been a wonderful experience. There are many good players and the stress level is high this season. I am happy that I lasted for three months, I think that I am a better version of myself today. There is so much to learn in the house — it’s a game of patience, willpower and courage. There were times when I was down and out, and I didn’t know I had so much patience and courage to fight back, because in the real world, if you don’t like something, you walk away from it. Living in the house, I also realised that I am logical and sensible compared to a lot of others (laughs!). I also got in touch with my emotional side; I am happy to know that I could be this emotional. I am proud that I played with a lot of dignity and tried my best not to stoop low even when people provoked or instigated me.


You seemed quite strong in the first half, voicing your opinions and standing up for what you believed was right. However, towards the second half, many people felt that you ended up being under the shadow of Sidharth Shukla, Paras Chhabra and Mahira Sharma... Inside the house, if you show a sign of weakness, the others pounce on you, they use and abuse it. Being a wild-card entrant, my biggest challenge was to forge an alliance; I needed it. I bonded with Hindustani Bhau (Vikas Fhatak), Himanshi Khurana and Asim Riaz. After Bhau and Himanshi were eliminated, it was just Asim and me in the group. We were going strong; I trusted him completely and thought that it was mutual. However, his behaviour changed overnight, and he became rude towards me. Actually, he played a game with me, just like he played with Sidharth Shukla. The moment he found Himanshi and me, he walked out on Sidharth. And the moment he found Rashami Desai, he walked out on me. If you lose a strong alliance at that point in the game, you become directionless. It happened with me right in the middle of the game, when I was going strong. Around that time, Sidharth and Paras exited the house (temporarily) because of health reasons. When they returned, their attitude towards me had changed. I am very organic with my relationships. I didn’t befriend anyone as part of a strategy or game. I befriended them because I truly liked them. And just when we were about to become a team, I was eliminated. I am always pro-Sidharth. There were issues with him in between, but I have known him for a long time, and I will vote for him. I want him to win the show. At the moment, Asim is the most negative and toxic person inside the house.

Many of your supporters felt that you looked stronger with Asim and comparatively weaker when you joined Sidharth, Paras and Mahira’s team...
I must have looked strong when I was with Asim, because he doesn’t have a mind of his own. On the other hand, Paras, Mahira and Sidharth have very strong opinions. It wouldn’t have been possible for me to jump in and share my opinions with them right away. At that time, winning their trust was most important for me; I had to be mellow, show them who I really was, and didn’t want them to feel threatened. In that process, it might have come across that I was losing my mojo, which wasn’t the case.

When Asim and you were good friends, a section of the audience also felt that there was something more between the two of you. What do you have to say about that?
Oh no, not at all. In fact, Asim did hit on me initially. It wasn’t direct, but everyone in the house had sensed it. However, I made it clear to him that I am a much older, married woman, and I am not interested. That’s when he shifted his focus to Himanshi, who, too, didn’t give him any attention back then. So, he used my friendship and me to get close to her. I have never taken a fancy for Asim. Yes, I did love him as a friend; I always called him my little kiddo in the house.

You said that this season features a lot of good players. Who is your pick?

Irrespective of the kind of game they play — negative or positive — Sidharth and Asim are good. Paras is also a very good player, he knows how to manipulate and play with your psyche. Shehnaz Gill, too, is a player. She knows exactly what she is doing, she is not a child. I don’t think Rashami is a good player, I don’t know what she is doing in the house.


You said that unlike the outside world, you can’t walk away from people inside the house. Given a choice, who would you have walked away from?

Definitely, Asim and Shehnaz. She had started getting on my nerves towards the end. In fact, her pretence of being a stupid, little child was getting to everyone in the house. Sidharth, too, is done with Shehnaz now. It’s sad, as they looked great together for the audience.


While you had the support of Sidharth, Paras and Mahira inside the house, your husband Parag Tyagi was your biggest supporter outside. The two of you come across as contrasting personalities. While he seems to be the emotional one, you are quite practical. What’s the secret to your happy marriage?

I don’t know... I think it’s all him. I am not an easy person to live with. Yes, I am very practical. It’s not that I am not at all emotional, but I am not very expressive. It happens when you start working at a very young age. Being a woman in a man’s world, it’s more of a self-preservation tactic. But Parag understands me and knows how much I love him. I think his understanding has kept us together and also, the immense trust he has in me. But I have to say that after three months in the Bigg Boss house, I do want to show that man some more love now. That’s something I realised for the first time in my life. You understand the true value of something when you are away from it. I can’t live without Parag now."
"Created: Jan 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,Bigg Boss Kannada showed audiences the real me: Priyanka,"Kannada audiences remember Priyanka best for her negative roles in serials like Avanu Mathu Shravani and Agnisakshi. Then, she decided to take part in this season of Bigg Boss Kannada and audiences got to look past the vamp image that she has onscreen and see Priyanka for who she really is. Going by the fact that she managed to stay 105 days in the house, they must have liked what they saw, which vindicates her decision to be a part of the show. “Not even in my wildest dreams did I think that I would stay in the house for so many days. I guess that staying true to myself worked for me to survive in the house. So far, I have only been doing characters with grey shades on TV, which is all that audiences have seen of me. I wanted to present myself to them and I think I have. It would have been great if I could have made to the finale, but I understand that’s how the show goes,"" she says, adding that she is hopeful that her stint in the house will widen her horizon as far as more positive roles go.
Her biggest takeaway, though, is that the time away from family has made her a lot more independent. ""I have had a protected upbringing and have always been chaperoned by my mother or brother when I head out. So, the time on Bigg Boss Kannada was a first for me, given that I had to take care of myself for so many days, while also living with a bunch of people. The show has definitely also taught me to be a lot more patient,” says Priyanka, adding, ""But what will stay with me forever is the opportunity I got to dance with Sudeep sir and that he applauded my efforts when I was adjudged best contestant in the house.""

On the show, the actress was quite close to co-contestant Kuri Prathap, with whom she spent most of her time.“ I am a big fan of Kuri since his Majaa Talkies days; he has such great comic timing. He is a wizard as far as as funny one-liners go. He is also the first contestant I got to meet in the house. We used to pull each other's leg throughout the day,” she says.

Now that the show is close to the finishing line, who does she think will win this year? “Obviously, Kuri is my favourite, but Vasuki Vaibhav and Shine Shetty are tough competition too. They have given their best while doing tasks and have participated in all activities without any issues. It's going to be a nail-biting race to the finish,” she signs off."

There are ways to keep your Data private: tech Experts
Cross check third-party apps before downloading them on your phone
The first step to ensure a safe browsing experience is to be wary of what to download and what not to. “Downloading unknown apps and taking quirky psychological tests on social media puts your personal information at risk. People take random quizzes to find out how rich they’ll be when they are older or how they’ll look at a certain age. These tests serve as a psychological record of you for social media companies,” says Srinivas Kodali, an independent researcher on data and cybersecurity. A digital security expert from Delhi says, “Malicious apps downloaded on your phone can access your messages and can read your one time passwords (OTPs) too. Even though the digital era makes life convenient, the privacy of your data depends on how you use these apps.” He adds, “It is a trade-off for the convenience you enjoy by using these apps.”
Even trusted apps, that have a million downloads to their credit, ask for permissions that they do not need. “For instance, there are photo editing apps and e-commerce related apps that ask for permission to view contacts and messages. One must always question why an app needs a certain permission, does it really require access to your messages and contact list to function? It is advisable to avoid downloading apps that ask for too much access,” says techpreneur Sandeep Sarma.

Look for open-source alternatives
Open-source softwares not only provide a better browsing experience, but are also deemed to be safer, state experts. “It makes sense to find open-source alternatives to major software systems, as they address legal and ethical issues from a consumer’s perspective, which makes them safe and easy to use. One can search for these alternatives online,” says Srinivas.

Say no to free WiFi and random emails that promise fortunes
“Even if you do need to use WiFi, say, at a café or another unknown location, avoid logging on to your personal online banking websites, personal emails or utility-based apps when you are using a network that you are not familiar with. Unsecured networks may put vital information at risk. Be extra wary if a network provides you an offer that is too good to be true,” advises Vijay Raj, a cyber security risk evangelist.


Look for privacy add-ons on your web browser
As browsers track all your information and maintain a specific record of internet users, experts advise using privacy add-ons and extensions that can block access from other online software. “Privacy extensions and add-ons not only protect us from attacks by hackers, but also block ads that show up while browsing. Several privacy add-ons block trackers too,” says Vijay.

Don’t use the same password for all your accounts
If you have resorted to using the same login ID and password for all your accounts in your effort to remember them easily, you are putting your personal information at risk. “In case of a security breach on even one of your accounts, a hacker can access your other accounts and steal data,” explains Srinivas.





Before you download a new app on your phone...
- Avoid using an unknown free app, especially one that has very few downloads.
- Always read the reviews for an app before
downloading it.
- Find out the origin of the app. It’s important to know where it was developed. Free apps designed in countries that have earlier been in news for data theft should, anyway, raise an alarm.
- Don’t install any app through links received in your email or SMS that also offer prize money. Clicking those links often exposes you to malicious
malware and can gain access to your system.
- Be alert while downloading apps. For example, a gaming app shouldn’t ask for your location. Finance-related apps shouldn’t ask for access to your camera. Be mindful of the permissions you give.
- Declutter your phone by removing apps that you don’t use on a regular basis.
- Install apps from official app stores.
- Use the right browsers or VPN.
- Turn off location services when not required or if you don’t want your phone to save or track your timeline."

"Created: Jan 28, 2020, 01:00 IST",Onkar Kulkarni,Entertainment,Alaya F: I made a conscious decision to not involve my family members too much in my film journey,"In her debut film, 'Jawaani Jaaneman', Alaya F will be seen sharing screen space with senior actors like Saif Ali Khan and Tabu. The confident young actress is excited to step into the industry and see her dream come true. In a candid chat with BT, she talks about the nepotism debate, stepping on the silver screen, the relationship she shares with her mother, Pooja Bedi, and more. Excerpts:
From dreaming about joining movies to landing a role in a film with Saif Ali Khan, and now gearing up for its release — has it sunk in that you are all set to make your big Bollywood debut?
It is all so magical! It’s surreal to see yourself on big screen. When I saw the film for the first time, I told myself that I would need some time to process this. I enjoyed watching myself on big screen so much that I have already seen the film thrice!

Did you always dream of becoming an actress? How did you prepare yourself to achieve your goal?
I have been prepping for the last four years. For two years, I studied direction and acting in New York. When I returned to Mumbai, I took training in acting, diction, gymnastics, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and dancing, which included forms like contemporary, Bollywood, Kathak, etc.
What’s the feeling of working with a senior and experienced actor like Saif Ali Khan in your first film?
Saif is very smart and witty. You can talk to him about anything and everything. He has been very supportive and is a very giving actor. At the time of my solo shots, he would be there on the set to give me cues to better my performance. The first time I faced the camera for this film, it was for a scene with him. It was a dialogue-heavy, seven-page long scene, which was a six-minute shot. Nitin sir (Kakkar, director) asked me to do it in a single, continuous shot. It was a crucial scene where I reveal that I am Saif’s daughter. I was nervous, but it went off smoothly without rehearsing the scene with Saif. The two of us shared a great comfort level.

You hail from a film family. Did you seek support and advice from your mother Pooja Bedi and grandfather Kabir Bedi?
I made a conscious decision to not involve my family members too much in my film journey. Family members tend to get emotional. So, I felt it is better not to mix the two. I told my mother right at the beginning that I would only reach out to her for advice. I am happy that she understood and supported me. Likewise, I go and seek my nana’s (Kabir Bedi) opinion, too. I like making my own decisions. I remember showing my nana my acting videos from my classes, and he would give his perspective on them. I grew extremely close to my nana during my process of becoming an actress.

Was your mom impressed with your training and prep? The way the industry functioned when she entered showbiz was quite different…
She was impressed. She has seen me slog for 14 hours straight, hopping from one class to another. She once told me about how she got her first film. She said that she was 10 minutes late for a meeting, and so she called the director to inform him about the delay and apologise for it. He was really surprised. He was so impressed with her sense of discipline that he cast her in the film without a second thought. That was the time when actors used to come on sets many hours late. Bollywood has changed so much since then. There are so many female-centric films today, and everything is content-driven. It’s a competitive world out there, and everyone is well prepared. If you are not up to the mark then someone else, who is more prepared, will take your place. Everyone is so dispensable now. I firmly believe ki agar kaam karoge toh kaam milega. I love competition; it keeps everyone on their toes and motivated. You see your contemporaries and learn from their achievements and mistakes, too. It’s interesting to see the paths each one (contemporaries) takes. Alia Bhatt and Priyanka Chopra (Jonas) have inspired me a lot. They are so talented and do such diverse work.

Though you are yet to make your debut, you are already popular on social media. Did you think of that as a stepping-stone to a career in Bollywood?

No, at that point of time, I wanted to be a director and not an actor. So, it had nothing to do with that. In fact, I went to New York to study direction, but later I changed my mind and enrolled in acting classes. When I came back to India and started training here, I was almost disconnected from social media. I lost interest in it. Now that I am an actress, I am making an effort to get back and be more active on social media. However, it is difficult to get back into it once you’ve cut it out of your life. I know it is important, but I don’t take it too seriously.


Recently, while talking about nepotism, you said, ‘Even in our struggle, we are privileged’. It looks like you are ready to take the debate head-on and address it.

Of course! I expected these questions to come my way. However, I feel it’s great that a subject like this is being talked about. It is a reality, and there is no need to run away from it. Addressing it sensitively and acknowledging it is the most important part. For me, no matter what people say, I am still going to act. I am going to do what I love. Hopefully, one day I will be good enough and no one will consider me a product of nepotism. Look at actors like Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor... people don’t look at them as privileged star kids, because they are so good at what they do. Today, we see a lot of talent on the rise in Bollywood. We have star kids coming in, plus, there are talented actors from outside the industry, who are getting great opportunities, too. With more talent around, there are better opportunities and more films are being made.


Earlier in the interview, you said that you share a great bond with your mother. Your parents got divorced when you were really young. How has your relationship with your parents evolved over the years?

My mother allowed me to be my own person. She encouraged me to have an opinion and voice it loud and clear. My mother and I are rarely on the same page, and that makes for good conversations and debates. We look at things differently. I share a great equation with my father (Farhan Furniturewala), too. Both my parents have been there for me constantly and consistently. My dad is extremely excited ever since I told him that I wanted to get into movies. He used to send me newspaper clippings about films under pre-production and ask me to audition for them. Ever since I came back from New York, I spent a lot more time with him. He knows nothing about movies (laughs!). My mother lives in Goa now, while my brother Omar is in Los Angeles, where he is studying business management. Since I live alone in Mumbai, I tend to see my father a lot more. I share a great equation with my stepmother (Laila) and stepbrother Zaan. I hate calling him my stepbrother; he is my brother. He is just four years old and is very cute. I also share a good equation with my mom’s partner (Maneck Contractor). He, too, is excited about my film debut. A few days ago, we went to a multiplex to watch a movie, and when we saw a poster of Jawaani Jaaneman, we all started clicking pictures with it."

The details of Elli’s role had been kept under wraps so far, but now we can reveal her complete look from the action thriller. With dreadlocks and tattoos covering her head and body, the actress has got the grunge look bang on. She says, “I was overjoyed when Mohit sir called me to audition for Jessie’s part in the film. I wanted this film so badly that I nailed it in my first audition. He was happy with my audition and wanted me to look absolutely different and stand out in the film. For me, it’s a very tricky character to play.”

Talking about how the team put together the look, she says, “We tried several looks for the role, but when I put on this wig with the dreadlocks and it was a unanimous yes from the entire team. I don’t think there has ever been a character like this attempted before in films. They wanted tattoos, but I requested Mohit sir to let me pick the tattoos myself. It gave me a better understanding of the world that she’s coming from. I have never been to any rave parties and Jessie is somewhat a wild child. But, I have given this role my all.”"

"Created: Jan 28, 2020, 01:00 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Varun Dhawan: Bhushan Kumar backing Street Dancer 3D rebooted our energies,"As the producer of 'Street Dancer 3D', Bhushan Kumar refused to cut corners and wholeheartedly supported director Remo D’Souza and actor Varun Dhawan’s dance film. With the movie currently playing in cinemas, Bhushan and Varun discuss the road ahead. Excerpts:
'Street Dancer 3D' has opened in cinemas to a positive response from the audience. How does it feel?
Varun: Now that the film is out, I can tell you that Remo sir and I wanted to make it for a very long time. An international studio that was expected to back it, stopped its movie production business and our dream was pushed onto the backburner. Bhushanji’s entry on the scene just rebooted our energies. With his expertise, he backed this film phenomenally. He ensured we didn’t compromise on anything.
Bhushan: This is a musical franchise that I wanted to have on T-Series’ repertoire for a long time. When Remo made ABCD, I told him that he should have partnered with me on it. He hadn’t approached me because my company at that time was barely making movies. ABCD 2 got us talking again, but we couldn’t partner. This time around, things fell into place.


Hindi cinema thrives on song and dance, but not too many films are made in this genre. Do you think that will change with Street Dancer 3D? Bhushan: I wanted to explore dance as a genre because we have developed action, comedy, thriller, slice-of-life and family drama as genres, but not dance. I’ve always believed that dance and music can be used effectively to tell a story. 'Street Dancer 3D' proves that point.

Varun: In our film, the screenplay progresses with songs. We don’t have the tracks just because they sounded like potential hits. We couldn’t have asked for a better and more complete album.


Now that you have a dance franchise on hand, how do you plan to take it forward?

Varun: With the passage of time, I don’t know how often and for how long I will be able to lead the cast of this franchise. It’s a youth-centric franchise and it should be moulded to suit the patterns of the youth viewership. Even if I am not acting in this franchise, I probably will back it with Bhushanji as a producer. As for working together, Remo sir, he and I have discussed something and we’re quite excited about it.

Bhushan: I agree with Varun that it’s a youth franchise and its stories can be crafted in so many ways to appeal to the young audience. Apart from Varun, Tiger Shroff is the only other person I see fitting into this franchise. About working with Varun, I’ve realised that he can be a great producer. He’s been a strong and reliable support for me on this film."

Amit says, “'Ole Ole 2.0' from 'Jawaani Jaaneman' is one of my favourites. Growing up, I’ve loved this Abhijeet Bhattacharya song and it was an honour to share the Tanishk Bagchi track with him. Both the versions are equally good, mine has different lyrics and antara.""


He adds, ""Progression wise, there are differences when it comes to the chord structure, and mukhre ka start bhi thoda alag hai. Yeh aaj ka EDM hai aur woh uss samay ka EDM tha.”

Talking about his songs 'Ajj Mera Yaar' and 'Sachiyaan' in 'Bhangra Paa Le', the singer says, “Both the songs have an EDM-bhangra vibe, and are beautiful. I am happy that I got an opportunity to work with the composers Kaushik-Akash-Guddu (KAG) and Shubham Shirule-Ana Rehman.”


Amit has also lent his vocals for the Telugu and Tamil versions of 'Street Dancer 3D’s 'Dua Karo'. “I had to work on getting the pronunciations right for 'O Deva Deva' (Telugu) and 'Maraven Yen Adayaalam' (Tamil). People are appreciating the songs and I am really honoured. It’s a great composition and I’m happy with all the appreciation that’s coming my way.”"

"Created: Jan 29, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,It’s time to lend an ear to your chapped lips,"Whether or not we like to talk about it, chapped lips can make one feel conscious and uncomfortable all day long, especially during the winter season. Even when you slather those fruity lip balms or the good old petroleum jelly, nothing seems to work if the dryness is extreme. Lips also lack oil glands, making them easily susceptible to flakiness. It has long been established that our skin constantly tries to communicate with us, flagging underlying health risks and deficiencies. Similar is the case with lips. Maybe it’s time to lend an ear to your lips, then? Here’s what experts have to say…

Nutritional deficiencies may make your lips crack and peel
“Also referred to as cheilitis, chapped lips are often characterised by cracking, fissuring and peeling. Keeping yourself hydrated, complemented by home remedies, may help if it’s not an extreme case yet. But if the dryness aggravates, it might point to other health issues,” says Dr Sudha Menon, internal medicine physician. According Kavita Devgan, nutritionist and holistic health consultant, it could indicate several underlying problems such as dehydration, constipation, anaemia, diabetes, reaction to certain medications, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the body as well as stress and anxiety.
‘Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy lifestyle’
Urging people to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle, Dr Sudha says, “Take care of your lips by having a balanced diet regularly and keeping yourself hydrated. It’s also important to keep an overall check on your health, so that there are no deficiencies in your body.”
Adding to that, Kavita says, “Any problem in the body usually shows up on the skin first. So, don’t ignore dry lips, thinking it to be just a seasonal issue. If it’s not because of dehydration, get your sugar and haemoglobin levels tested as well. Instead of resorting to cosmetic options, visit a doctor if the problem remains.”

Secrets to keeping your lips supple, naturally
Natural lip balms made from plant butter, oils, beeswax can help to keep your lips smooth and supple. Sugar scrubs can work well to remove dead skin. Also, desi ghee, shea butter, mango butter, cocoa butter can work wonders during dry weather. Neetha Bhoopalam, natural cosmetologist and food consultant, shares a few natural lip masks. She suggests that these should be used three times a week to see good results...

HONEY MASK
Unrefined honey can be applied 2-3 times a day. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes and then wash it off.

ROSE PETAL MASK
Wash a few rose petals and soak them in milk. One hour later, grind the petals into a smooth paste. Let it stay on your lips for 15 minutes before washing it off with water.

BANANA MASK
Mash one banana, add a teaspoon of honey to it. Apply the paste on your lips for 20 minutes and then wash it off.

These may cause your lips go dry…

Smoking

Too much exposure to hot or cold weather

Consumption of too much caffeine

Genetic issues

Excessive use of lipstick

Dehydration

Vitamin and mineral deficiency"

"Updated: Jan 29, 2020, 15:56 IST",Hansy Sanctis,Lifestyle,This Bharatanatyam performance draws inspiration from school textbooks,"Performing arts lovers in Bengaluru are in for a treat as Bharatanatyam dancer, teacher and actor, Matangi Prasan, and her students are poised to showcase a unique set of three demonstrations over the weekend. These will be an amalgamation of dance and concepts of science, history and other academic subjects. Speaking about the show — which took about six months to conceptualise, choreograph and execute — Matangi says, “The idea came from the topics that I used to assign to my students during their summer vacation. Apart from teaching them dance, I used to give them other small tasks, such as writing short stories, drawing portraits of their favourite characters and so on. Eventually, I decided to use dance to explain simple scientific concepts to children as an effort to make it easier for them to understand the importance of these concepts.”
The dance production also includes live music, as artiste YG Srilatha collaborates with the dancer to come up with original compositions for the recital. “We needed a live music setup for the audience to have an immersive experience. The overall rehearsals took nearly four months, and as we were working with children, it was slightly more difficult than usual to put things together, but it was worth the effort,” says Matangi.

In total, there will be six musicians. The dance performance is divided into three parts, which will be performed by students of different age groups. Here’s what they will comprise…

Panchatantra reimagined through elements of dance

The Panchatantra set will be performed by students aged between 5 and 8 years. “It will be interesting for the audience to see how these kids will portray human values and virtues through dance narratives,” she says. When students take the role of a teacher on stage

“Students in the age group of 9 to 14 years will put up acts based on the scientific concepts they learn at school. Here, they will enact as teachers, explaining these concepts. The choreography is based on their opinions as well,” Matangi explains.

Putting the spotlight on women warriors of our past

Focusing on the portrayal of female warriors in the history of Karnataka, students aged 15 and 16 will portray the roles of goddesses and women warriors. “This act will concentrate on the women who adorn the pages of our history books. We have taken inspiration from legends like Onake Obavva, Rani Abbakka Chowta and Kittur Rani Chennamma,” she sums up."

It was one of those greeting cards that played music when opened. It was delivered to the girl I liked. But the card fell out during class and the music caught the attention of the teacher, who happened to be my relative. Needless to say, I got reprimanded by my family (chuckles). On that note, I must add that my friend who was behind the plan is now a lecturer at an engineering college in Mysuru.
Milana: (laughs) My god, poor thing. Please don't give out his name also.

Regifted something that was gifted to me:
Amrutha: I have; I used to get a lot of heart-shaped pillows, so I used to re-pack and gift them to my friends who loved cheesy items. Krishna: Milana and I have this tradition where we gift each other phones. If I have gifted her a model, I ask her to gift me the upgraded version of the same phone.
Milana: That’s preplanned and not regifting.
Krishna: Once the production started, we have refrained from gifts. (Chuckles)

Milana: Coming to the question, I value all my gifts though, because people have specifically picked it out for me. So, I never regift anything.

Been in Love with my teacher:

Krishna: I have. I had a teacher who had a bob cut — similar to the hair style that Milana sports in the film. My ultimate goal in life, then, was to marry a fair-complexioned girl (chuckles). That teacher was very pretty, so I was quite in awe of her.

Fallen in love at first sight:

Milana: Never. If I don’t like someone, it doesn't matter how good looking they are. So, I have never fallen in love at first sight.

Krishna: In fact, I have often fallen in love at first sight, till I had my first girlfriend in college. I would wait to see if anyone I was charmed by, was falling for me too..

Amrutha: I have fallen in love at first sight too.. I was in ninth grade and there was a tabla teacher that we’d seen at a competition. I was in an all-girls school, and had not seen too many good-looking boys, so I was immediately in love. He had tapped my shoulder and said ‘Well, done’. If I remember correctly, I did not take a bath for a few days to preserve that memory (laughs).

Krishna: Yes, she’s not bathed since then (Laughs)"

Directed by Bear Grylls, the adventure reality TV series had featured Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
According to an official from the Karnataka Forest Department, the team has been granted permission to shoot near the Kalkere and Moolehole forest range, which is located close to the Kerala border. “We have ensured that the filming process does not cause any harm to the flora and fauna of the forest, particularly the tigers. The shooting has begun, and it will continue for a few days.”

The last time Rajinikanth shot in Karnataka was for his movie Lingaa. It was filmed on the Mysore Palace premises and at the Linganamakki Dam, in Shivamogga. According to sources, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, who is expected to reach Mysuru today, will shoot for the show at the forest for a day or two.


Activists furious over authorities granting permission to shoot at the national park
Environmentalists and wildlife activists are raising their voice against the decision to allow the team of Man vs. Wild to shoot at the national park and tiger reserve. Joseph Hoover, of the United Conservation Movement, says, “Around this time last year, more than 10,000 acres of forest land was destroyed due to fire. Forest officials, thus, need to be more concerned about ensuring that such an unfortunate incident does occur again, rather than being busy with providing security for people who are shooting a show in the forest. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change should have given it a proper thought before granting permission for the shoot during this season.”"
"Created: Jan 29, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,"I quit school to do dance-based films, but am yet to do one: Adah Sharma","For actress Adah Sharma, attending the cultural festival of Jain (deemed-to-be) University, was special, as she got to experience the mayhem of a college fest — something she hadn’t until now. Adah says, “I’ve never been to college as a student, so it was really good to be in college. I began doing movies right after I completed Class 10. I wasn’t a bad student; in fact, I was really good at both studies and sports and used to top my class too.” Why did she quit academics in favour of films, then? “When I was in Class 10, veteran actress Asha Parekh had come as the chief guest for the school annual day. Her manager, who was present at the event, saw my Kathak performance and told me that I’d definitely get to be in a film about or with a lot of dance. This was when I told myself that I want to be an actress and do dance-related films. The irony is that I haven’t really danced in a movie yet. Somehow, all the movies I’ve chosen until now have shown me as the sweet girl, so there’s hardly any dancing, except for Charlie Chaplin 2, in which I had worked with Prabhudeva. Even in my Kannada film Ranavikrama, I got to dance a little, but I’m yet to do an out-and-out dance-based film,” she explains.


What she has got to do, though, is a variety of roles across platforms and languages. “I’ve decided that I’ll do stuff that appeals to audiences, irrespective of where they are from. After my debut in the digital space, when I went touring across the country to promote my film Commando 3, I was often asked updates about the show. What the digital age has ushered in is a level playing field for everyone, with no regional or language divide. Everybody now seems to be a part of the same industry,” she signs off."

This time around, he will be seen as the lead in a Telugu serial that will be backed by Nagarjuna. Titled Trineni, this serial is a family drama with a thriller twist, he says, adding, “I have been receiving offers from Tamil and Telugu production houses for a while now. This serial seemed just right, as it comes from a prestigious banner and has an interesting storyline that I could not refuse.”

The move, says Chandu, means that he will spend a fortnight each month in Hyderabad. But that doesn’t mean goodbye to Kannada TV. “Kannada will remain my mainstay and I am, in fact, in talks for a serial here too. Trineni allows me to test waters in a different market. I play the lead in a story that centres on a heroine who has premonitions that help my character avert danger. This thriller element in it is what piqued my interest. I can speak a fair bit of Telugu, but am hoping to brush up on my language skills by the time the show goes on air,” he says."

"Updated: Jan 29, 2020, 16:30 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,Team Love Mocktail talks about the film and the masti on set,"When a film team comprises youngsters, you expect them to be fun and forthcoming in their conversations. And that's just what we were privy to when the team of this week’s Love Mocktail, including lead actor, director and producer Krishna, actor-producer Milana Nagaraj and actor Amrutha Iyengar dropped by for a quick chat with us. Amid talk about the film, the trio’s banter revolved around Krishna and Amrutha's humour, with Milana, constantly chipping in as moderator and the voice of reason. Excerpts from our chat:
Apart from being the lead actors, Milana and Krishna, you've juggled multiple roles for this film...
Milana Nagaraj: Yes, I have taken on the role of producer, makeup artiste amd dabbled a bit in art direction too.

Krishna: I am producer, actor, director and stunt and song choreographer on this film. But Love Mocktail is not only about the two of us; there are a few adorable leading ladies who’ve worked in the film.
Krishna: (Points teasingly at Amrutha) More adorable than her, I mean... She is from Mysuru. We were looking for the loveliest lady in Mysuru, and she fit the part. When we started shooting, few other boys from Mysuru who were playing character roles in the film complimented her as a ‘sakkath figure’, which proved to us that we had chosen the right person for the role.
Amrutha: (chuckles) It was a lot of fun working with this team. My role is quite peppy and bold — unlike what I’ve taken on before.
Krishna: I had actually asked Amrutha to slim down for the role, but she put on weight.
Amrutha: My god! (Covers her face)
Krishna: In fact, considering that the narrative follows my life from teenage to the mid 30s, I had to look younger in some portions and lost 10 kilos.
Amrutha: Seeing Krishna motivated me to lose weight.

There’s a lot of jocund camaraderie between you guys. What was the atmosphere like on the set ?
Krishna: (With a poker face) When we approached Amrutha for the role, we asked her if she would reduce her remuneration, but she refused vehemently.
Amrutha: Absolutely false! (Laughs)
Milana: On a more serious note, when you are acting with people, you are always wary of possible tantrums, but Amrutha was a joy to work with.
Krishna: When we’d first met, I’d warned Amrutha that I am quite strict and a taskmaster as director and asked her not to get upset in case I reprimanded her, and she was like ‘No, no, you are so sweet.’ How wrong she was.
Amrutha: As a hero, he was extremely jovial. The minute he went behind the camera, he’d be like, ‘Do you not know how to do this scene?’ and reprimand us in front of everyone. When we had a shot together, he’d then set the scene, and come and say ‘This is the background of this scene, we need to hold hands and look like we’re in love.’ In my head I was thinking, ‘You’ve just yelled at me, and now you expect me to be all lovey-dovey?’ That was my experience on the first day. Having said that, I must say that Milana did a great job and helped me through the process. She deftly handled makeup, hairstyling and even helped me out with my scenes. So, if I look good onscreen, credit goes to her, and our cinematographer, Sri Crazymindzz.
Krishna: The shooting was a lot of fun too. Not many on the set knew the entire script, so they’d watch the comedy scenes and laugh, which was an amazing experience for us, as we realised that part of our job was done.
Milana: And while there was a lot of fun on set, Krishna had a lot of rules too. No selfies on set; we were not allowed to use our phones..
Amrutha: Exactly, he let us breathe, that’s all.

Milana: Yes, and eat during our breaks. (Laughs)

Krishna: In fact, I used to be so preoccupied with direction, that I would forget that I have lines too.

Milana: That was only time I could walk up to him and mock him saying, ‘Come on, everyone knows their lines. What about you?’


Tell us a bit about the film...

Krishna: It is a coming-of-age film, which follows the journey of the protagonist from the age of 14 to 35, and the women he encounters. In that sense, Love Mocktail is not a film, but an experience. Special shout out to Milana, who trusted my vision and helped fund it with the remuneration from the other films she did.

Milana: I took on each of those films because they were good projects. But I did save up to work on this project. Initially, though, I was not sure what Krishna was up to on set. Our cameraman and I would wonder what he was shooting, as he would shoot a frame, then ask me to change costume and shoot another. It was only on the editing table that we realised his logic; he was trying to save time and shoot as much as possible in those settings, when light and other factors were favourable. Even though Krishna doesn’t write down scenes, he has the process entirely thought out in his mind. So all our confusions got cleared and we were elated."

While Mani won the Best Debutant Director Award, Saththam took home the Best Film From Sridevi JIFF Indian Panorama Award. Interestingly, it’s the only Tamil film to have won an award at the festival.

“JIFF is one of the most prestigious film festivals, and to have won two awards for my first feature film is a big boost for me. The film had its Indian premier on January 20, at the festival, and we received the awards on the next day. This year, the festival had 2,161 submissions, out of which 219 films were screened. Of the 42 feature films that were chosen, only 12 are Indian movies. Filmmakers from the US, Canada, China, France, Poland, Norway and Sweden, among other countries, had showcased their work here. Saththam was the only Tamil feature film to be screened, apart from two other Tamil short films,” says Mani, whose previous featurette Magizhvan went to 32 film festivals and won 19 international awards.


A psychological thriller, Saththam traces the story of a man who hears unusual sounds, which others can’t. “Can a sound haunt a person? Are these sounds trying to tell him something? That’s what we’ve explored in this film. It stars Kamaal Lenin, Rohit Muralidharan, Santosh, TVV Ramanujam, Rajan Iyer, late Kovai Senthil, Nakshatra Rao and Preetha,” says Mani, who is also a lecturer at Bharathirajaa and GP Krishna’s film institutes. He’s already screened the film to directors like Vasantabalan and Vasanth.

He adds, “I hope production houses come forward to support award-winning independent films and give them a good release so that the product reaches a wider audience.”"

"Created: Jan 30, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,"Urban farmers are exploring the art of growing plants with no soil, less water","Modern-day families are increasingly becoming an environmentally conscious and health conscious lot. It is, therefore, no surprise that organically grown vegetables are fast replacing the flower pots in balconies and terrace gardens. Taking a step forward, city dwellers are now adopting hydroponics — the method of growing plants without soil. Although clean eating caught the fancy of people a few years ago, this subset of hydroculture is a relatively new practice that’s finding prominence in neighbourhoods across India.
What is hydroponics?
Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead. “Only certain plants can naturally grow in water. We dissolve nutrients in water and then attach a pump that allows this water to rotate throughout the system,” says Vinod Chakravarti, co-founder of a company that deals with hydroponics.


It’s easy to set up; also saves water
With water scarcity and a lack of space counted among issues faced by people, the method of hydroponics comes in handy for those keen on growing their own vegetables at home. Bengaluru-based Patanjali Bhat, says, “Hydroponics is easier to follow, and yields superior quality greens that are way better than the ones in the market. My intention was to provide my family fresh and chemical-free greens. We set up the arrangement on the the terrace of our house. This method worked better for us, as we do not have regular water supply in our house. Hydroponics helped me save up to 70% of water.” Laasya Samhita, a Bengaluru-based biologist, adds that hydroponics works for people who love gardening, but do not have the space for it. “I used to struggle to find good-quality greens in the market, and even if I did, they would always be sprayed with pesticides. I love gardening, but have no space. With hydroponics, I grow my own greens, and save water now,” says Laasya, adding that greens like Amaranth grow well in Bengaluru.


Hydroponics finds takers across the country
Experts say that while the no-soil farming trend has gained momentum in recent times, people are experimenting with various greens and plants. “Hydroponics is on the rise in India, as there is more awareness now, thanks to social media. We get orders from across the country. We have worked with nearly 300 homes in Hyderabad alone in the past one year, and the numbers are increasing. The set-up we have is uniform across the country. However, in places like Jaipur, where the temperature can get really high like during summer, people won’t be able to do much,” says Vihari Kanukollu, CEO of a vertical urban farming company in Hyderabad.
According to Atrei Chatterjee, who runs a restaurant in Kolkata, this method has worked wonders for him. “I am able to use fresh supplies of greens from my home. I have grown lettuce, and now I’m looking at growing herbs, tomatoes and other leafy greens. The only challenge I faced initially was in controlling the light conditions, but once I got the hang of it, it became easy. In Kolkata, one can grow greens throughout the year. There are a variety of easy-to grow spinach varieties,” he explains.

Corporates, too, are joining the bandwagon
Divith Savarkar, an urban farmer who works at a corporate office in Bengaluru, says, “Our office was on the look-out to support green initiatives when we chanced upon hydroponics. We installed this structure at our workplace as well, and currently, we have a variety of lettuces and spinaches growing within our office premises.” Instead of having ornamental plants, offices can grow greens and other vegetables, he explains, adding, “If we have more such arrangements in place at offices, employees too tend to become curious. A lot of our employees have also adopted the technique to grow their own vegetables at home.”



Benefits of Hydroponics farming
No soil required: With no soil requirement, one need not worry about how porous the soil has to be for the roots of the plant. Seeds are initially grown in a porous medium like cocopeat.

Fast growth: The yield in a hydroponics set up is faster. Growth from seed to saplings takes about three weeks, and for a sapling to produce takes 2-3 weeks.

No chemical pesticides: Since plants are grown right at home, one need not spray the plant with any form of chemical pesticide. Organic ones will do.

Saves water: Unlike traditional farming, this method saves water as the water is continuously circulated throughout the setup.

Higher yield: Once the produce is harvested, the continuous rotation of nutrients in the water ensures that the next cycle of growth and harvest too takes place faster.


What can be grown using hydroponics

Salad greens like lettuce
Basil
Spinach
Coriander
Amaranth
Methi

The challenges

Initial set up: The initial cost of setting up pumps and connecting the plants in your space is on the higher side.

Requires controlled lighting: While this can be set up as part of the initial investment, it is necessary to create a glass house effect with various materials to avoid harsh and direct sunlight on plants.

Not feasible in naturally high temperature zones: It is not practical to practice hydroponics in places like Chennai and Jaipur, where the temperature can get really high during summer."

Bengaluru, too, seems to be in panic mode, with three suspected cases already being registered at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases.
Some 3,275 passengers were recently screened at the Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru. Also in the city, the total number of people quarantined at their homes is six, while the number of people under observation in hospitals is four, as per information from the Health Department as of January 28.

Health experts are urging people not to be anxious and adopt preventive measures, instead. “CoV is a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus, however, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. These viruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and human beings,” says Dr KK Aggarwal, President of the Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI).

Symptoms range from common colds to severe infections
According to World Health Organisation, patients who are diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection are showing a number of symptoms. Most of them seem to have a mild version of the disease, but about 20% of them appear to be progressing to the severe phase — which includes pneumonia, respiratory failure and even death. “In case of virus infections, it is important to strictly follow all preventive measures, which involves maintaining proper hand hygiene, covering mouth while coughing and sneezing and avoiding close contact with people who have a cold or flu-like symptoms. People also need to ensure that they have thoroughly cooked meat and eggs,” advises Dr Ambanna Gowda, a city-based internal medicine consultant.


‘Don’t fall prey to misleading Coronavirus rumours’

Experts have also advised not to pay much attention to WhatsApp forwards that are currently making the rounds. “People need to stop forwarding unauthenticated messages about Coronavirus on their phones. This is only spreading misinformation, which, in turn, leads to more fear among people,” says Dr Ambanna."
"Updated: Jan 30, 2020, 11:20 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,"Shoot at Site: Clap, a sports drama with emotions thrown in","It looked as if a state athletic meet was taking place there — but a closer exploration revealed a film shoot was on. It was the sports movie, Clap, that was being shot and in keeping with the story, athletic tracks had been recreated in a ground in Tondiarpet.
The banners that had been put up, the flex hoardings, and the typical arrangements found at a running track, the officials roaming around there, runners — all of them were shooting for Clap, being directed by Prithivi Adithya, starring Aadhi
in the lead.


According to Prithivi, the bilingual (Tamil and Telugu) sports movie revolves around 400m sprint. “We have been shooting here for a week,” begins the director, adding, “We are filming a state athletics meet here.”
“Aadhi’s character trains a young Bhagyalakshmi (Krisha Kurup). To bring in the authenticity, we have roped in real officials officiating at a real ground and have chosen proper equipment. For the national meet, we are planning to go for a ground in Kerala, Vizag or Bangalore. The officials were surprised at our efforts to bring in an authentic ambience of a running event. A lot of research has been done in terms of shaping the ground, putting up the boards, costumes, and so on,” Prithivi explains.

I play a sprinter and coach in the film
Currently, I’m shooting for my portion as a sports coach. This is one of the crucial sequences in the film, which appears in the latter half. While these scenes do not require me to be very fit, I will also be shown as a sprinter in the film, and for that I will have to train vigorously for almost two months to look like an athlete. To perfect my portions, I have been learning terminologies associated with the sport. It is a pleasure to learn the nuances behind the athletes’ nature, their timing, reflexes, and so on. It’s been a while since I have gone for a makeover and this film has finally given me that opportunity.
— Aadhi, actor



I underwent three months’ training to look athletic
I play Bhagyalakshmi, an athlete in the movie. This particular scene is about the challenge I face and my equation with my trainer. To tell the story of anybody who represents the country in any sport is a big deal. The film is very close to my heart and I am enjoying the experience. I have done a lot of homework — I took training for three months to look like an athlete. I lost 11kg in a short span. An athlete’s energy is spent during the moments when he/she runs on the ground. I started learning a lot about athletes — the way they sit, their behaviour, everything.

I play a sports journalist in the film
I play a sports journalist in this movie. At the moment, we’re shooting an emotional scene between an athlete and her coach. Another emotional track runs between the coach and the female lead of the film, who is a hockey player. Ilaiyaraaja sir loved the script and he has given us three extraordinary songs already. He is getting ready with another one now, for montage. We had shot a few portions in Ramojirao Film City. A flashback portion is to be shot later in a college stadium in the city. Till recently, we had many scenes that required the presence of huge crowds. Those were shot in a multiple-cameras set-up.

- Karthik, actor-producer



A sports movie has to be very believable on screen
We have extensively used different cameras and multiple-camera set-ups to capture the running race sequences. A sports movie requires to be very believable, and for the same, it is necessary to present movements in the most credible manner. I have worked in sports documentaries before and it came in handy. We have used wide lens for many crucial scenes to create maximum impact on screen. Though we were lucky to have a favourable climate throughout our schedule, the mud track was complicated. We had to depend on Gyro Stabilized Heads, which we brought in from Hyderabad.

She will play the strict and stern mother of the male lead, Simba Nagpal. Ask her if she is comfortable playing mother roles and Gouri replies, “I don’t look at it as playing mother or mother-in-law. If a role is strong and challenging, I will take it up. I was waiting for a meaty role for a long time, but nothing interesting came my way. So, when this opportunity came, I accepted it.”

She adds, “Yash (Tonnk, husband), and many other actors like me are in that age group when options are getting limited. There are so many talented actors in our age group, but it looks like the makers are only interested in making shows revolving around the hero and heroine. Every show can’t be about the boy falling in love with the girl, leaving the rest of the characters insignificant. Makers should try newer concepts. Unique subjects are being explored in cinema and other platforms, giving actors across age groups an opportunity to showcase their talent. Like other platforms, television also needs to wake up and smell the coffee.”

Gouri is also hoping that someday, she will get to work with Yash. She says, “Where are the roles and scripts? It’s not that I want to play his wife on screen or be paired romantically opposite him. There are so many other roles that can be conceptualised. But, somehow, makers are not thinking of senior actors nowadays when they are coming up with new shows.”"
"Created: Jan 30, 2020, 00:00 IST",Tanvi PS,Entertainment,Presenting a fantasy ghost story was challenging: Raj Pathipati,"Raj Pathipati has a self-confessed love for fantasy films and it's no surprise that his first release, Kaanadante Maayavadanu, starring Vikas and Sindhu Loknath in the lead, falls in that genre. As the movie gears up for its release, Raj recollects his filmi journey — from starting out as an assistant director under industry bigwigs like Yogaraj Bhat and Pawan Kumar to now, awaiting the release of his directorial debut...
Hassle-free entry into films

I was in Class 10, when I realised that I wanted to be a director. I used to make storyboards and write scripts. Coincidentally, my father, and filmmaker Yogaraj Bhat sir’s brother, are close friends. So, that gave me an easy entry to the industry. Yogaraj sir did not agree immediately to have me assist him. I had asked him when he was making Gaalipata, but he refused and asked me to continue studying and come back later, because after Class 10, I had only done a year-long diploma. Instead of going back to class, I worked on a few short films and went back to him again. This time, he introduced me to Pawan Kumar sir, who got me to assist him on Lifeu Ishtene. I then returned to Yogaraj sir’s camp to work on his film, Drama. Since then, he’s been my mentor. Most of the members of team Kaanadante Maayavadanu are people who have worked with him, including Vikas sir, Sindhu Loknath, Achyuth Kumar sir and our cinematographer, Sugnyan. So, in a sense, my journey in films has more or less been hassle-free.

All the hurdles I have faced came from making this film — be it the elaborate time that the CGI work took or the unfortunate circumstance of losing Raghava Uday (the film’s antagonist who passed away on the set of Masti Gudi, after shooting for most of Kaanadante Maayavadanu), among others. At one point, I had even gone to an ashram, to get away from all the frustration. I took time out, read spiritual books, energised myself and got back to the grind in the hope that things will come through — and they did. I am indebted to our producers, and my team for working with me through this four-year journey.

A fancy for fantasy

I love the genre of fantasy films. When you write about the unimaginable, and the surreal, there will always be new elements to explore, and non-cliched scenes to compose. Normal stories have same shades everywhere, but fantasy cinema is fresh. When I pitched my movie ideas to people they warned me that I was going overboard with my imagination, and that it might be logistically difficult to pull off, for a debut. So, I started off with a simple fantasy narrative. In Kaanadante Maayavadanu, Vikas sir plays a ghost, and Sindhu is his love interest. The story begins when Vikas’ character, Rummy, dies. He is chased by a dog called Bhageera, who belongs to the villain. However, upon Rummy’s death, Bhageera sees the soul detach from the body and chases the soul instead. And it’s through Bhageera that Rummy meets Achyuth sir, who is a senior ghost. The narrative, which is filled with love, action, drama, comedy, unfolds from here on, to see how Rummy fights for the injustice that has been meted out to him, seeks revenge, and even reaches out to the woman he loves. As a ghost, his powers are quite limited, so, that brings in the suspense element and adds hilarity.


The way forward...

One challenge that Vikas sir and I faced, initially, was that during the movie pitch, our narration wasn’t engaging enough, so I’d often bore potential investors because I narrate shot by shot (chuckles). We are planning to remake the film in Tamil and Telugu, for which I’d be taking on the role of director again. Thankfully, for the remakes, I do not have to pitch, and need only showcase the film (chuckles). On a serious note, I will work on my narration skills and learn to communicate better. I have more stories to tell, and my filmi journey will be decided by how this movie fares."

While they had a ball shooting in 10 degrees Celsius, Shivin Narang risked his life for a sequence. The actor, who has thalassophobia (fear of deep waters), shot in the Ganges for seven hours. ""Rishikesh was really fun. I needed a break and nothing could have been better than visiting the mountains. There was a sequence where I had to jump in the Ganges and that was shot at the exact place where people go rafting. The water was very cold and the location was also risky as the whole stretch was full of huge rocks and I was in the water for seven hours. After a point my fingers and toes went numb,"" Shivin tells us.

For Shivin, jumping in the ice cold water was the most difficult part. ""I had done rafting before in Manali, but there I was doing it with experts, and rafting for a scene is totally different. It was just me and Jennifer Winget on the boat and that was risky. The toughest part for me was to jump in the water. It was so cold and people around me were wearing two-three jackets and I just had a shirt on!"" he shares.

Shivin Narang and Jennifer Winget shoot in Rishikesh

Being a Delhiite, Shivin has visited Haridwar multiple times, but he says he never got a chance to explore Rishikesh. ""I have been to Haridwar many times, but I have only been to Rishikesh once and that was many years ago. I finally got an opportunity to explore the city while I was shooting. We covered Ganga aarti, visited Ram Jhoola, Laxman Jhoola and we also shot at some locations outside Rishikesh. Reaching those places was very difficult as there are no proper roads, so this trip was one adventure for me,"" he says."

"Updated: Jan 30, 2020, 17:09 IST",V Lakshmi,TV,Most Desirable Woman On Television 2019: Nakshathra,"She charms her audience with her effervescence and the camaraderie she shares with them. This has made her one of the most sought-after hosts on the small screen. She’s dabbled in movies, has done several popular short films and web series, and even played one of the leads in Lakshmi Stores. Meet Nakshathra Nagesh, the Chennai Times Most Desirable Woman On Television 2019. In a no-holds-barred chat with us, the youngster tells us why she loves being in front of the camera, how she handles all the fan attention and of course, her relationship mantra.Excerpts:
You’ve been chosen Chennai Times Most Desirable Woman On Television 2019. What does this tag mean to you?
When I learnt about it, I felt it was all a dream. I immediately called my brother to tell him about it. He was like, ‘Wait, what? Are you serious?’. I was not even sure I heard it right. Many people have been featured on the list and to make it to the number one slot feels so unreal. But now that I know it’s true, I think it’s very flattering.

You are among the favourite hosts and actresses on the small screen. How do you handle the fan attention?
I feel people who work in the television industry are really fortunate. The kind of recognition they get for their work is huge. People identify us as one amongst themselves. ‘She is our girl’… that’s the kind of vibe they get. If an elderly woman approaches me, it’s because she looks at me like her daughter. That’s the kind of connection we have with our audience. They don’t look at us as just celebrities. Once, I was with my friends at Times Square, New York, and this family came to me and said, ‘Neenga Nakshathra dhaane?’. My friends were like, ‘This is crazy man, people are recognising you in New York!’. That, for me, was very overwhelming.
With so much attention coming your way, there must have been some proposals as well. So, what’s your relationship status?
I am in love – with my job. All my focus is on work. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I’ll say I’m happily taken, by my job. (laughs)

Well, when you do get into a relationship, what would you look for in a man?
If you are witty, you’ll get me. You can floor me with your brilliance. I am not into looks all that much, it’s the brain that I’m after.

What’s a relationship no-no?
Dishonesty. I don’t like it if you lie even for the simplest thing. For instance, instead of saying what I’m wearing is not okay, you sugar-coat it and say it’s great to just please me, I’d not like it. Every relationship should be founded on honesty and genuineness.

Which is the most ridiculous rumour you have heard about yourself?
A rumour that I was married to a co-host, but my co-host was single. There was this website that had carried an article on how I secretly married Dhilip Rayan, and if you clicked on the hyperlink on his name, another article said how he was the most eligible bachelor in town. If you are anyway coming out with rumours, you might as well make sense!

Well, spread a rumour about yourself then...
I’m the tenth in line to the throne of England (laughs).

If you have to give one advice to women who want to make it big in their respective fields, what would it be?
There’s a misconception that attitude is a bad thing to have. It’s not an insult or derogatory to say that you have an attitude. It could be good attitude or bad attitude, but you need to have an attitude. It’s your ideals and principles, and I don’t think you should let the world change that. So, you have to be very, very strong in what you think is right or wrong. Also, I feel that everybody needs to have work-life balance. It’s a little more for women because as much as we need our family to support us through our career, we also have to be there for our loved ones. As long as we get these things right, we are going to go places.

You’ve been active in the industry, juggling TV and films. What drives you?
I love to work. If I get an opportunity to either host or act 365 days a year, I would do it with all my heart. It gives me immense pleasure to be in front of the camera. So many people have asked me what I like doing the most— anchoring or acting. To be honest, I can’t choose between the two because I’m passionate about both. I love being on screen and work can never tire me. I’m very inquisitive and whenever I shoot, enn directors-ayum cinematographers-ayum kelvi kette konnuduven. I’ve been curious about every aspect of shooting – big screen or small screen.


You are also playing the lead in a film…
Yes, Vanigan happened out of the blue. It’s a new team and there’s so much passion involved. It’s a make-or-break film for everybody who is involved. It’s motivating that people like Yuvan Shankar Raja are

backing it.


Four-play with Nakshathra

My choice for Most Desirable Man: Suresh sir; we worked together in Lakshmi Stores. He’s the wittiest man I know
My new Insta bio would read...: When I just started working on television, I’d written this bio: ‘The girl next door who also happens to be on the TV next door’
My best feature: Many people tell me that they love my smile. I think that’s because I’m always smiling
A quality that’s desirable about me: Nothing can pull me down – I don’t let anything dampen my spirit. Optimism and staying positive through everything has kept me going.
